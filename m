You are right, it still gets mapped but with page granularity. However,
to James' point, we still need to know the crashkernel range in
map_mem() as arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() relies on having page rather
than block mappings.

Breaking block mappings into pages is a lot more difficult later. OTOH,
the default these days is rodata_full==true, so I don't think we have
block mappings anyway. We could add NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS if KEXEC_CORE is
enabled.

I think for 1 we could also remove the additional KEXEC_CORE checks,
something like below, untested:
