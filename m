In some of my test systems I observed that, the TSC value does not fall
within the expected error window the first time the HPET channel expires.

I inferred that the error computed using the coarser tsc_khz was wrong.
Recalculating the error window with refined tsc_khz would correct it.

However, restarting the timer has the side-effect of kicking the timer and,
therefore pushing the first HPET NMI further in the future.

Perhaps kicking HPET channel, not recomputing the error window, corrected
(masked?) the problem.

I will investigate further and rework or drop this patch as needed.

Thanks and BR,
Ricardo
