Provided at which stage?

For the qemu type use case, that's not true.  In that case we
*require* the available mapping ranges to match what the guest
platform expects.

Again, a hint at what stage of the setup process are you thinking?

Ok, I'm not quite sure how this works.  The holes are guest visible,
which generally means they have to be fixed by the guest *platform*
and can't depend on host information.  Otherwise, migration is totally
broken.  I'm wondering if this only works by accident now, because the
holes are usually in the same place on all x86 machines.
