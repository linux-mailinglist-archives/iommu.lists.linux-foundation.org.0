Except that's documentation for the non-coherent allocation API, rather 
than the streaming API in question here. I'll refrain from commenting on 
having at least 3 DMA APIs, with the same set of sync functions serving 
two of them, and just stand back a safe distance...




Anyway, the appropriate part of that document is probably:

   "You must do this:

    - Before reading values that have been written by DMA from the device
      (use the DMA_FROM_DEVICE direction)"

I'm not saying it constitutes *good* documentation, but I would note how 
it says "have been written", and not "are currently being written". 
Similarly from the HOWTO:

    "If you need to use the same streaming DMA region multiple times and
     touch the data in between the DMA transfers, the buffer needs to be
     synced properly..."

Note "between the DMA transfers", and not "during the DMA transfers". 
The fundamental assumption of the streaming API is that only one thing 
is ever accessing the mapping at any given time, which is what the whole 
notion of ownership is about.

Thanks,
Robin.
