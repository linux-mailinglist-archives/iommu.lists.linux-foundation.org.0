The case where the IOMMU does not support snoop-control for such a
device already works fine, we can't prevent no-snoop so KVM will
emulate wbinvd.  The harder one is if we should opt to allow no-snoop
even if the IOMMU does support snoop-control.

The mechanics are different, but this is pretty similar in concept to
KVM learning coherence using the groupfd today.  Do we want to
compromise on kernel control of wbinvd emulation to allow userspace to
make such decisions?  Ownership of a device might be reason enough to
allow the user that privilege.  Thanks,
