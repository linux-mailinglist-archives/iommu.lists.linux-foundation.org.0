Ok, but the reason this happened is that the initial version of type 1
*could not* be used on PPC.  The original Type 1 implicitly promised a
"large" IOVA range beginning at IOVA 0 without any real way of
specifying or discovering how large that range was.  Since ppc could
typically only give a 2GiB range at IOVA 0, that wasn't usable.

That's why I say the problem was not making type1 generic enough.  I
believe the current version of Type1 has addressed this - at least
enough to be usable in common cases.  But by this time the ppc backend
is already out there, so no-one's had the capacity to go back and make
ppc work with Type1.

Right, which means the kernel must (at least in the common case) have
the capcity to choose and report a non-zero base-IOVA.

Hrm... which makes me think... if we allow this for the common
kernel-managed case, do we even need to have capcity in the high-level
interface for reporting IO holes?  If the kernel can choose a non-zero
base, it could just choose on x86 to place it's advertised window
above the IO hole.

The concept makes sense in general.  The devil's in the details, as usual.
