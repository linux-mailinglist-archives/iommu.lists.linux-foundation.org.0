        num_irqs = 0;
        while ((res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_IRQ, num_irqs))) {
                num_irqs++;
        }

As the above code, num_irqs is calculated based on the number of dtb or acpi
configuration items, it can't be too large. That is, there is almost zero chance
that devm_kcalloc() will fail because num_irqs is too large.
