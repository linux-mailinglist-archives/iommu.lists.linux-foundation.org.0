Ok.. below is a previous *similar* comment that you had for one of my patches that change default-domain dynamically.. could you please elaborate it more so that I could have better understanding?
Specifically this one.. "locking all devices in the group and then do the re-attach will introduce a lock-inversion with group->mutex". I didn't get which function call chain would lead us to lock inversion. Could you please shed some light here?

+static int is_driver_bound(struct device *dev, void *not_used)
+{
+	int ret = 0;
+
+	device_lock(dev);
+	if (device_is_bound(dev))
+		ret = 1;
+	device_unlock(dev);
+	return ret;
+}

[SNIP]

+	/*
+	 * Check if any device in the group still has a driver binded to it.
+	 * This might race with device driver probing code and unfortunately
+	 * there is no clean way out of that either, locking all devices in the
+	 * group and then do the re-attach will introduce a lock-inversion with
+	 * group->mutex - Joerg.
+	 */
+	if (iommu_group_for_each_dev(group, NULL, is_driver_bound)) {
+		pr_err("Active drivers exist for devices in the group\n");
+		return -EBUSY;
+	}

Another question I have is.. if it's racy then it should be racy even for one device iommu groups.. right? Why would it be racy only with multiple devices iommu group?

Regards,
Sai
