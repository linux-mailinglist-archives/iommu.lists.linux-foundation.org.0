Thank you for the answers, that was helpful.

I think I initially misunderstood TrenchBoot, thinking that a Secure
Launch'd kernel/userspace would be the "normal" OS that would
transition to multi-user mode and be available for users and
applications.  However, on reading your response it appears that the
Secure Launch'd kernel/initramfs exists only to verify a secondary
kernel/initramfs/userspace and then kexec() into that once verified.

I have to admit that I'm not sure I'm the most appropriate person to
review all of the Intel TXT related assembly, but I could give it a
shot as time allows.  I would think Intel would be willing to help out
here if one were to ask nicely :)

Beyond that, and with my new understanding of how TrenchBoot is
supposed to work, I guess my only other concern is how one might
verify the integrity of the Secure Launch environment on the local
system during boot.  My apologies if I missed some details about that
in your docs, responses, etc. but is this something that TrenchBoot is
planning on addressing (or has already addressed)?
