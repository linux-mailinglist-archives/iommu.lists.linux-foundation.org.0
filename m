Out of curiosity, how much of the difference is attributable to actual 
indirect call overhead vs. the additional massive reduction in visits to 
arm_smmu_rpm_{get,put} that you fail to mention? There are ways to 
optimise indirect calling that would benefit *all* cases, rather than 
just one operation for one particular driver.

Presumably those are deliberately worst-case numbers? After all, a 32MB 
scatterlist *could* incur less overhead than a 64KB one if things line 
up just right (still 16 ->map calls, but each with one fewer level of 
pagetable to traverse). TBH I find the significant regression of the 4KB 
case the most interesting - what's going on there?

My main reservation here is that we get an explosion of duplicate copies 
of almost the same code, and it's code that's just non-trivial enough to 
start being bug-prone. And it's all still only for one specific 
operation - your argument about calling through multiple layers for each 
element applies just as much to iommu_map() itself, so why aren't we 
trying to make more fundamental improvements with wider benefits? Indeed 
I can't imagine the existing iommu_map_sg() loop really adds significant 
overhead compared to a single iommu_map() call that results in the 
equivalent set of ->map calls to the driver.

At a glance, I reckon that simply extending the internal ->map and 
->unmap interfaces to encode a number of consecutive identical pages 
would already get us a large chunk of the way there; then we'd be in a 
better place to consider options for the io-pgtable interface.
