That's exactly the problem. v6 simply replaced one way to describe the
policy (domain ID) with another (dma-ranges). However, DT is not the
right place to describe policies, because it's the place to describe
hardware in a way agnostic from policies and use cases. In other
words, DT must not impose using the hardware in one way or another.

For example, we have two different companies that want to ship
products based on this SoC - A and B. Company A may want to put MDP
and camera in the same address space, but company B instead would
prefer MDP to be in the same address space as video. Because this
decision is stored in DT, one of them will have to change and rebuild
their kernel and maintain a downstream patch.

My suggestion to follow here would be to:
 - stop using dma-ranges for this purpose,
 - add an array in the MTK IOMMU driver that has a default map between
larbs and domains, e.g.

static u8 mt8192_domain_map[NUM_DOMAINS][NUM_LARBS] = {
   [0] = { 0 , 1, 0xff },
   [1] = { 4, 5, 7, 0xff },
   [2] = { 2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 0xff },
};

 - add a kernel command line parameter that allows overriding of this map, e.g.

mtk_iommu.domain_map="0:0,1:1:4,5,7:2:2,9,11,13,14,16,17,18,19,20"

would be equivalent to the array above. Same could be also given by a
Kconfig entry if one can't or doesn't want to add extra command line
parameters.

Would something like this work?
