Yes, the user would effectively get a dummy fd with no device access
until not only that device, but every device in the IOMMU group is
attached to a secure context.  Then we get into questions about whether
devices can be moved between contexts/ioasids within the same ioasidfd
and what that implies to both the device and all other devices within
the group as a device is transitioned and the system is potentially
exposed.

Right, but that doesn't solve the issue.  Removing a device from one
isolated context, even if to move it to another isolated context within
the same ioasidfd exposes the device and has implications for all
devices within the group.

That's fine for a serial port, but not a device that can do DMA.  The
entire point of vfio is to try to provide secure, DMA capable userspace
drivers.  If we relax enforcement of that isolation we've failed.

vfio_groups have an ownership model, iommu_groups do not.

I don't see how this provides isolation.  If a user only needs to
attach their devicefd to an ioasidfd to have full access to their
device, not even bound by attaching to an ioasid context, then we've
failed.  All devices in a group must be bound to a secure context for
the extent of the time that any device in the group is operated by a
user.  That seems non-negotiable to me.  Thanks,

Alex
