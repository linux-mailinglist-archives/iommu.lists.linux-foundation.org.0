A concrete example of something that could go badly if mmput() takes too
long would greatly help. Otherwise I'll have a hard time justifying the
added complexity.

I wrote a prototype that removes the device driver callback from
release(). It works with SMMUv3, but complicates the PASID descriptor
code, which is already awful with my recent changes and this series.

I agree. There is a difference, though, between invalid mappings and the
absence of a pgd. The former comes from userspace issuing DMA on unmapped
buffers, while the latter is typically a device/driver error which
normally needs to be reported.

On Arm SMMUv3 they are handled differently by the hardware. But instead of
disabling the whole PASID context on mm exit, we can quietly abort
incoming transactions while waiting for unbind().

And I think the other IOMMUs treat invalid PASID descriptor the same as
invalid translation table descriptor. At least VT-d quietly returns a
no-translation response to ATS TR and rejects PRI PR. I haven't found the
equivalent in the AMD IOMMU spec yet.

Thanks,
Jean
