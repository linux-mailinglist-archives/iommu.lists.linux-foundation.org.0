Sorry, but I am not interested in this. It was discussed in Jan last 
year without any viable solution.

Anyway we still have the long-term IOVA aging issue, and requesting 
non-cached IOVAs is involved in that. So I would rather keep the SCSI 
driver to requesting cached IOVAs all the time.

I did try to do it the other way around - configuring the IOVA caching 
range according to the drivers requirement but that got nowhere.

I'd say less catastrophically slow, not faster.

So how to inform the SCSI driver of this caching limit then so that it 
may limit the SGL length?

Thanks,
John
