The reason why this is true for generic APIs is because people actually
think about generic APIs a bit more than about custom APIs because they
need to be more future-proof.

That doesn't make it wrong to think hard about using custom APIs because
we also want those to be somewhat future-proof.

Those are common uses, yes.

Then why is there regmap-mmio?

That may be true now, but at least it is something formal rather than
just dereferencing some pointer and accessing registers through it. If
this ever becomes a problem it's something that we can more easily
address.

syscon is the most obvious that comes to mind. It is meant to address
the kind of use-case that tegra20-devfreq apparently needs here, where
you have registers for certain functionality that are located in a
completely different IP block from the rest of that functionality. Often
there are better alternatives to solve this, by reusing existing
infrastructure, such as pinmux.

In cases where no subsystem exists we typically use syscon, which are
implemented via regmaps, to gain access to shared registers.

Huh... why is the tegra20-devfreq device instantiated from the EMC
driver? That doesn't make any sense to me. If there aren't any registers
that the driver accesses, then it would make more sense to subsume that
functionality under some different driver (tegra20-mc most likely by
the looks of things).

On a side-note: once we move tegra20-devfreq into tegra20-mc, there's no
need for this look up at all anymore.

That's because MFD is a misguided effort to split drivers into parts
that fit nicely into Linux' subsystems.

See the above devfreq vs. memory-controller mess for why that's a bad
idea. If you have to jump through hoops like that (i.e. create a virtual
device for a driver to bind against and then look up the device tree
node of the originator of that virtual device to get at its resources)
there's something seriously wrong.

I'm glad we caught this before this made it in.

Great, that means it's not too late and we can still add that phandle.

No, we don't need the fallback because this is new functionality which
can and should be gated on the existence of the new phandle. If there's
no phandle then we have no choice but to use the old code to ensure old
behaviour.

We need to discuss this now because it has implications for the DT
bindings, which, once established, we will never be able to change
again. At least not in a backwards-incompatible way.

That implies that any code we add based on that assumption will have to
be maintained in the kernel basically forever. As you see for the case
of tegra30-devfreq that means we need the existing fallback to remain
backwards-compatible with older DTBs that don't have the link to the
memory controller to get at the frequency table.

Now, this is obviously something that we should've done since the
beginning but we didn't and now we're stuck with it. But we shouldn't
further compound the problem by doing things by halves now.

I had actually given up on that idea because it wasn't gaining any
momentum. But your point is valid for a different reason. Just because
there's currently no generic framework for memory controllers doesn't
mean there never will be, so we should design things with some
genericity in mind so that if something generic ever comes around we
have a simpler way of transitioning to it.

Okay, sounds good.
