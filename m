After second thought, it seems you mean the kernel code can output the below
to userspace:
1. total loops
2. sum of map and unmap latencies
3. sum of square of map and unmap latencies

+struct map_benchmark {
+	__u64 total_loops;
+	__u64 sum_map_nsec;
+	__u64 sum_unmap_nsec;
+	__u64 sum_of_square_map_nsec;
+	__u64 sum_of_square_unmap_nsec;
+	__u32 threads; /* how many threads will do map/unmap in parallel */
+	__u32 seconds; /* how long the test will last */
+	int node; /* which numa node this benchmark will run on */
+	__u64 expansion[10];	/* For future use */
+};

Then we calculate average map/unmap nsec and variance in the userspace
tool.
