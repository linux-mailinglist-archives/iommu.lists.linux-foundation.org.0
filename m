I don't really follow that argument - you're only adding support to two 
implementations with the awkward flag, so why would using a dedicated 
operation instead be any different? Whatever callers need to do if 
dma_pci_p2pdma_supported() says no, they could equally do if 
dma_map_p2p_sg() (or whatever) returns -ENXIO, no?

We don't try to multiplex .map_resource through .map_page, so there 
doesn't seem to be any good reason to force that complexity on .map_sg 
either. And having a distinct API from the outset should make it a lot 
easier to transition to better "list of P2P memory regions" data 
structures in future without rewriting the whole world. As it is, there 
are potential benefits in a P2P interface which can define its own 
behaviour - for instance if threw out the notion of segment merging it 
could save a load of bother by just maintaining the direct correlation 
between pages and DMA addresses.
