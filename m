Right, I agree that this seems something that merits the same level of 
separation
that exists for the page table walker attributes with respect to 
coherency, and
data buffer attributes with respect to coherency (i.e page table walker 
coherency
does not imply data buffer coherency--that is driven through 
IOMMU_CACHE).

Yes, that should work, as that'll leave the door open for there to be a 
DMA attribute
that can be wired up to IOMMU_LLC.

I'm not aware of such a usecase, but I believe that a coherent device 
will
have their buffers cached in the system cache anyway, as well as the CPU 
caches.
