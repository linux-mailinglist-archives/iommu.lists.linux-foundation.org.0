Correct, but optional on the device side. An IOMMU might *require* this for
proper normal operation. Our IOMMU's do not get the low 12 bits. Which is
why the spec gives SW a way to detect if the device is compatible for this
IOMMU implementation.

I think you are getting confused between the 2 different PCIe features.

ATS - Address Translation Services. Used by device to simply request the
Host Physical Address for some DMA operation. 

When ATS response indicates failed, then the device can request a
page-request (PRS this is like a device page-fault), and then IOMMU driver
would work with the kernel to fault a page then respond with
(Page-response) success/failure. Then the device will send a new ATS 
to get the new translation.

ATS and PRS are 2 separate orthogonal features. 
PRS requires ATS, but not the other way around.

Right, I should have been clear. The issue with PRI is we require responses
to have PASID field set. There is another capability on the device that
exposes that. pci_prg_resp_pasid_required(). This is required to enable PRI
for a device.
