Because it's fundamental to the isolation of the device?  What you're
proposing doesn't get around the group issue, it just makes it implicit
rather than explicit in the uapi.  For what?  Some ideal notion that
every device should be isolated at the expense of userspace drivers
that then fail randomly because they didn't take into account groups
because it's not part of the uapi?

Is it really a "VFIO group security concept"?  We're reflecting the
reality of the hardware, not all devices are fully isolated.  An IOMMU
group is the smallest set of devices we believe are isolated from all
other sets of devices.  VFIO groups simply reflect that notion of an
IOMMU group.  This is the reality that any userspace driver needs to
play in, it doesn't magically go away because we drop the group file
descriptor.  It only makes the uapi more difficult to use correctly
because userspace drivers need to go outside of the uapi to have any
idea that this restriction exists.  Thanks,

Alex
