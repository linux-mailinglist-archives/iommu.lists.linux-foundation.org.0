Well we also need to ensure that the CPU caches are properly invalidated
either in prepare_peek() or peek_done_not_ready(), so that the data is
not cached between subsequent peeks. This could translate to either
turning prepare_peek() into dma_sync_single_for_cpu(buf,
DMA_FROM_DEVICE, DMA_ATTR_NO_OWNERSHIP_TRANSFER_BUT_INVALIDATE_CACHES),
or it could turn peek_done_not_ready() into something that just
invalidates the cache.

I was also toying with the idea of having a copy-based peek helper like:

u32 data = dma_peek_word(buf, offset)

which leaves the ownership as-is, but copies out a single word from the
buffer at the given offset (from the bounce buffer or real buffer as
appropriate) without messing with the ownership notion. The trouble with
this idea is that ath9k reads two different words that are 44 bytes from
each other, so it would have to do two such calls, which would be racy :(
