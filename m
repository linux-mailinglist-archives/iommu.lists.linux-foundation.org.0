Hi Alex,

Thanks for doing this, really helps to catch up the current state. Please
see my comments inline.

I feel this combined document only focus on IOVA and DMA APIs, it is
considered as legacy DMA after scalable mode is introduced by Intel to
support DMA with PASID, shared virtual addressing (SVA).
Perhaps, we can also combine ./Documentation/x86/sva.rst

With scalable mode, it affects boot messages, fault reporting, etc. I am
not saying no to this document, just suggesting. I don't know where AMD is
at in terms of PASID support but there are lots of things in common between
VT-d and ARM's SMMU in terms of PASID/SVA. Should we broaden the purpose of
this document even further?
