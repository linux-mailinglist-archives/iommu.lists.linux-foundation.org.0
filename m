A user is only _supposed_ to access PASIDs allocated to itself.  AIUI
the mm_struct is used for managing the pool of IOASIDs from which the
user may allocate that PASID.  We also state that programming the PASID
into the device is device specific.  Therefore, are we simply trusting
the user to use a PASID that's been allocated to them when they program
the device?  If a user can program an arbitrary PASID into the device,
then what prevents them from attempting to access data from another
user via the device?   I think I've asked this question before, so if
there's a previous explanation or spec section I need to review, please
point me to it.  Thanks,

Alex
