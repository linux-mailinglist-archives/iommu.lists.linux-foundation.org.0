If that is the case, can we let VFIO only copy its own UAPI fields while 
simply passing the user pointer of IOMMU UAPI structure to IOMMU
driver for further size check and copy? Otherwise we are entering a
dead end that VFIO doesn't want to parse a structure which is not
defined by him while using version to represent the black box size
is considered as a discarded scheme and doesn't scale well...
