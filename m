I think the right way is for pIOMMU to enforce the right behavior. vIOMMU
can ask for a PASID and physical IOMMU driver would give what is optimal
for the platform. if vIOMMU says give me per-device PASID, but that can
lead to conflicts in PASID name space, its best to avoid it. 

Global PASID doesn't break anything, but giving that control to vIOMMU
doesn't seem right. When we have mixed uses cases like hardware that
supports shared wq and SRIOV devices that need PASIDs we need to 
comprehend how they will work without having a backend to migrate PASIDs 
to new destination.

for ENQCMD we have the gPASID->hPASID translation in the VMCS control.
For devices that support SIOV, programming a PASID to  a device is also
mediated, so its possible for something like the mediated interface to
assist with that migration for the dedicated WQ.


When we have both SRIOV and shared WQ exposed to the same guest, we 
do have an issue. The simplest way that I thought was to have a guest 
and host PASID separation.  Where the guest has its own PASID  space 
and host has its own carved out.  Guest can do what ever it wants within 
that allocated space without fear of any collition with any other device. 

Cheers,
Ashok
