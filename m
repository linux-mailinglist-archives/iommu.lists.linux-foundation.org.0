Well, I mean, at one point we didn't do the automatic iommu hookup, we
could have just stuck with that and added a helper so drivers could
request the hookup.  Things wouldn't have been any more broken than
before, and when people bring up systems where iommu is required, they
could have added the necessary dma_iommu_configure() call.  But that
is water under the bridge now.

fwiw, on these sdm850 laptops (and I think sdm845 boards like mtp and
db845c) the SMMU (v2) is taken out of bypass by the bootloader.  Bjorn
has some patches for arm-smmu to read-back the state at boot.

(Although older devices were booting with display enabled but SMMU in bypass.)

Unfortunately display lit up by bootloader is basically ubiquitous.
Every single android phone does it.  All of the windows-arm laptops do
it.  Basically 99.9% of things that have a display do it.  It's a
tough problem to solve involving clks, gdsc, regulators, etc, in
addition to the display driver.. and sadly now smmu.  And devices
where we can make changes to and update the firmware are rather rare.
So there is really no option to ignore this problem.

I guess if we had some early-quirks mechanism like x86 does, we could
mash the display off early in boot.  That would be an easy solution.
Although I'd prefer a proper solution so that android phones aren't
carrying around enormous stacks of hack patches to achieve a smooth
flicker-free boot.

I suppose arm-smmu could realize that the context bank is already
taken out of bypass..  although I'm not entirely sure if we can assume
that the CPU would be able to read back the pagetable setup by the
bootloader.  Maybe Vivek has an idea about that?
