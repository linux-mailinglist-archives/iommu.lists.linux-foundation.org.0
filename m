"its own special way" is arguable, VFIO is just making use of what's
being proposed as the uapi via its existing IOMMU interface.  PASIDs
are also a system resource, so we require some degree of access control
and quotas for management of PASIDs.  Does libvirt now get involved to
know whether an assigned device requires PASIDs such that access to
this dev file is provided to QEMU?  How does the kernel validate usage
or implement quotas when disconnected from device ownership?  PASIDs
would be an obvious DoS path if any user can create arbitrary
allocations.  If we can move code out of VFIO, I'm all for it, but I
think it needs to be better defined than "implement magic universal sva
uapi interface" before we can really consider it.  Thanks,

Alex
