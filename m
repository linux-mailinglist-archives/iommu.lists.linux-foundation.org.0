Note that there's some annoying inconsistency across architectures, and 
with the {acpi,of}_dma_configure() code in general. I guess Christoph 
might be thinking of the case where iommu_setup_dma_ops() *does* end up 
being called off the back of the bus->dma_configure() hook a few lines 
below the context above.

iommu_setup_dma_ops() itself is indeed not the appropriate place for 
this (the fact that it can be called as late as driver probe is subtly 
broken and still on my list to fix...) but
bus->dma_configure() definitely is. Only a handful of buses care about 
IOMMUs, and possibly even fewer of them support VFIO, so I'm in full 
agreement with Greg and Christoph that this absolutely warrants being 
scoped per-bus. I mean, we literally already have infrastructure to 
prevent drivers binding if the IOMMU/DMA configuration is broken or not 
ready yet; why would we want a totally different mechanism to prevent 
driver binding when the only difference is that that configuration *is* 
ready and working to the point that someone's already claimed it for 
other purposes?

Robin.
