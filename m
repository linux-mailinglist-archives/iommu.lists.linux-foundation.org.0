Ok, good to know.

Sure, no problem. It looks like I forgot to actually Cc you on the series
as I had meant to, glad it reached you anyway.

I looked at the defza driver and that one appears simpler to me, as you
can look up the virtual address from an index, but it's possible I missed
what you do here. I meant specifically the calculation added by commit
67af2b060e02 ("[SCSI] dpt_i2o: move from virt_to_bus/bus_to_virt
to dma_alloc_coherent") in the dpt_i2o driver that can be used to
compute the virtual address. If something simpler works as well, that
is of course better.
