Isn't that still squarely the intent of the "dma-mem" binding, though? 
i.e. it's not meant to be a 'real' interconnect provider, but a very 
simple way to encode DMA parentage piggybacked onto a more general 
binding (with the *option* of being a full-blown interconnect if it 
wants to, but certainly no expectation).
