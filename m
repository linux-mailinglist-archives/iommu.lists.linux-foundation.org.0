ARM is always XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap

On ARM, Linux knows the MFNs because for local pages MFN == PFN and for
foreign pages it keeps track in arch/arm/xen/p2m.c. More on this below.

xen_arch_need_swiotlb only returns true on ARM in rare situations where
bouncing on swiotlb buffers is required. Today it only happens on old
versions of Xen that don't support the cache flushing hypercall but
there could be more cases in the future.

With the caveat that ARM is always XENFEAT_auto_translated_physmap, what
you wrote looks correct. I am writing down a brief explanation on how
swiotlb-xen is used on ARM.


pfn: address as seen by the guest, pseudo-physical address in ARM terminology
mfn (or bfn): real address, physical address in ARM terminology


On ARM dom0 is auto_translated (so Xen sets up the stage2 translation
in the MMU) and the translation is 1:1. So pfn == mfn for Dom0.

However, when another domain shares a page with Dom0, that page is not
1:1. Swiotlb-xen is used to retrieve the mfn for the foreign page at
xen_swiotlb_map_page. It does that with xen_phys_to_bus -> pfn_to_bfn.
It is implemented with a rbtree in arch/arm/xen/p2m.c.

In addition, swiotlb-xen is also used to cache-flush the page via
hypercall at xen_swiotlb_unmap_page. That is done because dev_addr is
really the mfn at unmap_page and we don't know the pfn for it. We can do
pfn-to-mfn but we cannot do mfn-to-pfn (there are good reasons for it
unfortunately). The only way to cache-flush by mfn is by issuing a
hypercall. The hypercall is implemented in arch/arm/xen/mm.c.

The pfn != bfn and pfn_valid() checks are used to detect if the page is
local (of dom0) or foreign; they work thanks to the fact that Dom0 is
1:1 mapped.


Getting back to what you wrote, yes if we had a way to do MFN lookups in
phys_to_dma, and a way to call the hypercall at unmap_page if the page
is foreign (e.g. if it fails a pfn_valid check) then I think we would be
good from an ARM perspective. The only exception is when
xen_arch_need_swiotlb returns true, in which case we need to actually
bounce on swiotlb buffers.
