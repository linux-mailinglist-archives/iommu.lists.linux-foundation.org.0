I'm throwing this out with a lot of hesitation, but I'm going to :-)

So we have been disussing this for months now, with some high level vision
trying to get the uAPI's solidified with a vDPA hardware that might
potentially have SIOV/SVM like extensions in hardware which actualy doesn't
exist today. Understood people have plans. 

Given that vDPA today has diverged already with duplicating use of IOMMU
api's without making an effort to gravitate to /dev/iommu as how you are
proposing.

I think we all understand creating a permanent uAPI is hard, and they can
evolve in future. 

Maybe  we should start work on how to converge on generalizing the IOMMU
story first with what we have today (vDPA + VFIO) convergence and let it evolve 
with real hardware and new features like SVM/SIOV in mind. This is going 
to take time and we can start with what we have today for pulling vDPA and 
VFIO pieces first.

The question is should we hold hostage the current vSVM/vIOMMU efforts
without even having made an effort for current vDPA/VFIO convergence.

As we have all noted, even without PASID we have divergence today?
