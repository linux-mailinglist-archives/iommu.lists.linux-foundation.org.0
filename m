OK, but I think we do have to cope with the fact that the limit is dynamic, and a CPU might be added which widens the mask. I think that's fundamental and not x86-specific.

The x86_non_ir_mask isn't intended to be directly exposed to any generic IRQ code.

It's set up by the x86 APIC code so that those x86 IRQ domains which are affected by it, can set it with irqdomain_set_max_affinity() for the generic code to see. Without each having to create the cpumask from scratch for themselves.

Thanks.

I don't actually like that very much. The IRQ remapping code could just compose the MSI messages that it desires without really having to care so much about the child device. The bit where IRQ remapping actually composes IOAPIC RTEs makes me particularly sad.
