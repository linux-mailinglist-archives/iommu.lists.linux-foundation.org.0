I'm not sure if that's a good fit. The swiotlb pools are allocated
during device initialization, so they require setting aside the
worst-case amount of memory. That's okay if you only use it with a
small number of devices where you know in advance approximately how
much memory they use. However, it doesn't work as well if you want to
use it with a large number of devices, or with unknown (i.e.
hotplugged) devices.

I'm not very familiar with the specifics of VT-d or restrictions with
the graphics hardware, but at least on the surface it looks like a
limitation of the i915 driver's implementation. The driver uses the
DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC flag, but never calls the dma_sync functions,
since things are coherent on x86 hardware. However, bounce buffers
violate the driver's assumption that there's no need to sync the CPU
and device domain. I doubt there's an inherent limitation of the
hardware here, it's just how the driver is implemented. Given that, I
don't know if it's something the iommu driver needs to handle.

One potential way this could be addressed would be to add explicit
support to the DMA API for long-lived streaming mappings. Drivers can
get that behavior today via DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC and dma_sync.
However, the DMA API doesn't really have enough information to treat
ephemeral and long-lived mappings differently. With a new DMA_ATTR
flag for long-lived streaming mappings, the DMA API could skip bounce
buffers. That flag could also be used as a performance optimization in
the various dma-buf implementations, since they seem to mostly fall
into the long-lived streaming category (the handful I checked do call
dma_sync, so there isn't a correctness issue).
