Yup.  Do we really still consider that there's some performance benefit
to be had by enabling a device to use no-snoop?  This seems largely a
legacy thing.

Yes and no.  Yes, if any domain is !IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY then we
need to emulate wbinvd, but no we'll use IOMMU_CACHE any time it's
available based on the per domain support available.  That gives us the
most consistent behavior, ie. we don't have VMs emulating wbinvd
because they used to have a device attached where the domain required
it and we can't atomically remap with new flags to perform the same as
a VM that never had that device attached in the first place.

Yeah, we need some better names, binding a device to an ioasid (fd) but
then attaching a device to an allocated ioasid (non-fd)... I assume
you're talking about the latter ioasid.

The IOMMU API group interfaces is largely iommu_group_for_each_dev()
anyway, we still need to account for all the RIDs and aliases of a
group.

We could almost eliminate the device notion altogether here, use an
ioasidfd_for_each_ioasid() but we really want a way to trigger on each
change to the composition of the device set for the ioasid, which is
why we currently do it on addition or removal of a group, where the
group has a consistent set of IOMMU properties.  Register a notifier
callback via the ioasidfd?  Thanks,

Alex
