FWIW, the intent is that that's only temporary.

Indeed, I have those patches in my stack already, I'm just waiting for 
this to land before I think about posting them. Once the DMA ownership 
series lands in parallel, VFIO can also get converted and 
iommu_capable() goes away entirely. At that point I have a patch for the 
Arm SMMU drivers to start actually using the new device argument, but 
Jason's new proposal now puts a twist on that...

On reflection, there's no real need for the internal method to change in 
lock-step with the external interface. I've no objection to holding off 
on adding that new parameter until it's reliably useful, and indeed now 
that I'm looking at it outside the context of the entire cleanup 
mission, that does sound like the right thing to do anyway :)

(also it turns out I need to respin this patch regardless since I 
generated it from the wrong point in my branch, where iommu_present() 
was already gone from the context in iommu.h...)

Cheers,
Robin.
