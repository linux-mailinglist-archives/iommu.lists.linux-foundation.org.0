Yes. So there is a point in time when the IOAS is frozen, and cannot take
in new incompatible devices. I think that can support the usage I had in
mind. If the VMM (non-QEMU, let's say) wanted to create one IOASID FD per
feature set it could bind the first device, freeze the features, then bind
the second device. If the second bind fails it creates a new FD, allowing
to fall back to (2) for the second device while keeping (1) for the first
device. A paravirtual IOMMU like virtio-iommu could easily support this as
it describes pIOMMU properties for each device to the guest. An emulated
vIOMMU could also support some hybrid cases as you describe below.

I'd like to understand better where the difficulty lies, with migration.
Is the problem, once we have a guest running on physical machine A, to
make sure that physical machine B supports the same IOMMU properties
before migrating the VM over to B?  Why can't QEMU (instead of the user)
select a feature set on machine A, then when time comes to migrate, query
all information from the host kernel on machine B and check that it
matches what was picked for machine A?  Or is it only trying to
accommodate different sets of features between A and B, that would be too
difficult?

Thanks,
Jean
