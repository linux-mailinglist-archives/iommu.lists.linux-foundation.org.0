Yeah true. I wasn't sure if that checkstop was actually caused by a
cached/uncached mismatch or something else, but looks like it was, from
the hostboot issue (https://github.com/open-power/hostboot/issues/180):

  12.47015|  Signature Description    : pu.ex:k0:n0:s0:p00:c0 (L2FIR[16]) Cache line inhibited hit cacheable space


So I'm not really sure how to square that with the documentation in the
user manual:

  If a caching-inhibited load instruction hits in the L1 data cache, the
  load data is serviced from the L1 data cache and no request is sent to
  the NCU.
  If a caching-inhibited store instruction hits in the L1 data cache,
  the store data is written to the L1 data cache and sent to the NCU.
  Note that the L1 data cache and L2 cache are no longer coherent.

I guess I'm either misinterpreting that section or there's some *other*
documentation somewhere I haven't found that says that it will also
checkstop.

cheers
