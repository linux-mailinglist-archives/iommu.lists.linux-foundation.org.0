But eventually do we really need all those capability getters? I mean
can't we simply rely on the actual call to VFIO_IOMMU_BIND_GUEST_PGTBL()
to detect any mismatch? Definitively the error handling may be heavier
on userspace but can't we manage. My fear is we end up with an overly
complex series. This capability getter may be interesting if we can
switch to a fallback implementation but here I guess we don't have any
fallback. With smmuv3 nested stage we don't have any fallback solution
either. For the versions, it is different because the userspace shall be
able to adapt (or not) to the max version supported by the kernel.

Thanks
