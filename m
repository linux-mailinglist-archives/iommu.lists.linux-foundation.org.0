The problem is that the lower-layer drivers don't know if upper consumer keeps reusing the same pages. They are running in different software layers.
For example, Consumer is here in mm/zswap.c
static int zswap_frontswap_store(unsigned type, pgoff_t offset,
				struct page *page)
{
	...
	/* compress */
	dst = get_cpu_var(zswap_dstmem);
	...
	ret = crypto_comp_compress(tfm, src, PAGE_SIZE, dst, &dlen);
	...
}

But the lower-layer driver is in drivers/crypto/...

Meanwhile, the lower-layer driver couldn't cache the pointers of buffer address coming from consumers to detect if the upper-layer is using the same page.
Because the same page might come from different users or come from the different stages of the same user with different permissions.
 
For example, consumer A uses the buffer as destination, then returns it to buddy, but consumer B gets the same buffer and uses it as source.

Another possibility is
Consumer A uses the buffer, returns it to buddy, after some time, it allocates a buffer again, but gets the same buffer from buddy like before.

For the safety of the buffer, lower-layer driver must guarantee the buffer is unmapped when the buffer returns to buddy.

I think only the upper-layer consumer knows if it is reusing the buffer. 

Thanks
Barry
