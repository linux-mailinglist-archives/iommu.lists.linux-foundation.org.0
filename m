At this point we have little choice, the ULP is responsible for
map/unmap because the ULP owns the CQ and (batch) unmap is triggered
by some CQE.

Reworking all drivers to somehow keep track of unmaps a CQEs triggers
feels so hard at this point as to be impossible. It is why the
rdma_rw_ctx basically exists.

So we have to keep the current arrangment, when the ib_sge is built
the dma map must be conditionally done.

At least in the kernel, the ULP has to be involved today in
IB_SEND_INLINE. Userspace does an auto-copy, but that is because it
doesn't have dma map/unmap. 

Without unmap tracking as above the caller must supply a specially
formed ib_sge when using IB_SEND_INLINE that specifies the CPU vaddr
so memcpy works.

But this all looks like dead code, no ULP sets IB_SEND_INLINE ??

Any place like rdma_rw_ctx_init() that decides dynamically between SGE
and MR becomes a mess. It would be manageable if rdma_rw_ctx_init()
was the only place doing this..

I haven't looked lately, but I wonder if it is feasible that all the
MR users would use this API?
