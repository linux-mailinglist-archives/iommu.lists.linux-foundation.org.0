I'm not sure if the spec really precludes hidden registers, but the
fact that these registers are explicitly outside of the capability
chain implies they're only intended for device specific use, so I'd say
there are no guarantees about anything related to these registers.

FWIW, vfio started out being more strict about restricting config space
access to defined capabilities, until...

    vfio-pci: Enable raw access to unassigned config space
    
    Devices like be2net hide registers between the gaps in capabilities
    and architected regions of PCI config space.  Our choices to support
    such devices is to either build an ever growing and unmanageable white
    list or rely on hardware isolation to protect us.  These registers are
    really no different than MMIO or I/O port space registers, which we
    don't attempt to regulate, so treat PCI config space in the same way.

See above commit, rather than quirks we allow raw access to any config
space outside of the capability chain.  My preference for trying to
place virtual capabilities at the same offset as the capability exists
on the PF is my impression that the PF config space is often a template
for the VF config space.  The PF and VF are clearly not independent
devices, they share design aspects, and sometimes drivers.  Therefore
if I was a lazy engineer trying to find a place to hide a register in
config space (and ignoring vendor capabilities*), I'd probably put it
in the same place on both devices.  Thus if we maintain the same
capability footprint as the PF, we have a better chance of avoiding
them.  It's a gamble and maybe we're overthinking it, but this has
always been a concern when adding virtual capabilities to a physical
device.  We can always fail over to an approach where we simply find
free space.  Thanks,

Alex

* ISTR the Broadcom device implemented the hidden register in standard
  config space, which was otherwise entirely packed, ie. there was no
  room for the register to be implemented as a vendor cap.
