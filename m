Right, but I'm explicitly not talking about the user managed page
table case.  I'm talking about the case where the IO pagetable is
still managed by the kernel and we update it via IOAS_MAP and similar
operations.

I don't really follow the connection you're drawing between a user
managed table and nesting.

Right...  and I'm still trying to figure out whether it can adapt to
either part of that.  We absolutely need to allow for multiple IOVA
apertures within a domain.  If we have that I *think* we can manage
(if suboptimally), but I'm trying to figure out the corner cases to
make sure I haven't missed something.

I don't really follow what you're saying here.
