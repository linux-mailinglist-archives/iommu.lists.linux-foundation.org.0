I don't mind assuming that ZONE_DMA is always from pfn 0 (i.e. no
dma_offset for such constrained devices). But if ZONE_DMA32 is squeezed
out with ZONE_DMA extended to 4GB, it should allow non-zero upper 32
bits. IIRC we do have SoCs with RAM starting above 4GB.

However, your patch didn't completely solve the problem for non-RPi4
platforms as there's hardware with RAM starting at 0 that doesn't need
the 1GB ZONE_DMA. We may end up with a combination of the two
approaches.

I don't remember the difficulties with parsing a DT early for inferring
the ZONE_DMA requirements. Could we not check the dma-ranges property in
the soc node? I can see bcm2711.dtsi defines a 30-bit address range. We
are not interested in the absolute physical/bus addresses, just the
size to check whether it's smaller than 32-bit.

Indeed, because we still have GFP_DMA around which can't fall back to
ZONE_DMA32 (well, unless CONFIG_ZONE_DMA is disabled).
