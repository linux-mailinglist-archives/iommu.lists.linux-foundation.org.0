To make sure that we're on the same page, this support alludes to the 
handling in
dma-iommu.c that reserves portions of the IOVA space for the PCI host 
bridge windows,
correct? If so, then yes, this is similar.

Does this mean that the driver should be managing the IOVA space and 
mappings for this device using the IOMMU API? If so, is the rationale 
for this because the device driver can have the information of what IOVA 
ranges can and cannot be used? Shouldn't there be a generic way of 
informing an IOMMU driver about these reserved ranges? Perhaps through a 
device tree property, instead of deferring this type of management to 
the driver?
