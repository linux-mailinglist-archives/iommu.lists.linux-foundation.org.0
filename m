Yes, that's what I meant. At a quick guess, something like the
completely untested diff below. It really comes down to what we want to
achieve here - if it's just to make this thing work at all, then I'd
favour bolting on the absolute minimum changes, possibly even cheating
by tainting the kernel and saying all bets are off instead of trying to
handle the more involved corners really properly. However if you want to
work towards this being a properly-supported thing, then I think it's
worth generalising the existing assumptions of page alignment from the
beginning.

Robin.
