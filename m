I have not measured the performance degradation. This will hit all AMD SEV,
Intel TDX, IBM Protected Virtualization VMs. I don't expect the hit to
be large since there are only few added operations per hundreads of copied
bytes. I could try to measure the performance hit by running some benchmark
with virtio-net/virtio-blk/virtio-rng.

Earlier I said:

Unfortunately, this doesn't make sense. Even if there's validation for
the size in the common virtio layer, there will be some other device
which controls a dma_addr and length passed to dma_unmap* in the
corresponding driver. The device can target a specific dma-mapped private
buffer by changing the dma_addr and set a good length to overwrite buffers
following it.

So, instead of doing the check in every driver and hitting a performance
cost even when swiotlb is not used, it's probably better to fix it in
swiotlb.

@Tom Lendacky, do you think that it makes sense to harden swiotlb or
some other approach may be better for the SEV features?
