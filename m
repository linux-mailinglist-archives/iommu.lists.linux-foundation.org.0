OK, I see your point. We'll think about the latter option (e.g. through 
DEVICE_FEATURE) and put a proposal for further discussion.

btw as I commented earlier, let's focus on PF first to enable vSVA 
given that there are already many flying bits. After that we can then
extend the vSVA support to VF based on discussions in this thread.

Thanks
