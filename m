There are a few different levels to consider for dealing with PPC.
For a suitable long term interface for ppc hosts and guests dropping
this is fine: the ppc specific iommu model was basically an
ill-conceived idea from the beginning, because none of us had
sufficiently understood what things were general and what things where
iommu model/hw specific.

=2E.mostly.  There are several points of divergence for the ppc iommu
model.

1) Limited IOVA windows.  This one turned out to not really be ppc
specific, and is (rightly) handlded generically in the new interface.
No problem here.

2) Costly GUPs.  pseries (the most common ppc machine type) always
expects a (v)IOMMU.  That means that unlike the common x86 model of a
host with IOMMU, but guests with no-vIOMMU, guest initiated
maps/unmaps can be a hot path.  Accounting in that path can be
prohibitive (and on POWER8 in particular it prevented us from
optimizing that path the way we wanted).  We had two solutions for
that, in v1 the explicit ENABLE/DISABLE calls, which preaccounted
based on the IOVA window sizes.  That was improved in the v2 which
used the concept of preregistration.  IIUC iommufd can achieve the
same effect as preregistration using IOAS_COPY, so this one isn't
really a problem either.

3) "dynamic DMA windows" (DDW).  The IBM IOMMU hardware allows for 2 IOVA
windows, which aren't contiguous with each other.  The base addresses
of each of these are fixed, but the size of each window, the pagesize
(i.e. granularity) of each window and the number of levels in the
IOMMU pagetable are runtime configurable.  Because it's true in the
hardware, it's also true of the vIOMMU interface defined by the IBM
hypervisor (and adpoted by KVM as well).  So, guests can request
changes in how these windows are handled.  Typical Linux guests will
use the "low" window (IOVA 0..2GiB) dynamically, and the high window
(IOVA 1<<60..???) to map all of RAM.  However, as a hypervisor we
can't count on that; the guest can use them however it wants.


(3) still needs a plan for how to fit it into the /dev/iommufd model.
This is a secondary reason that in the past I advocated for the user
requesting specific DMA windows which the kernel would accept or
refuse, rather than having a query function - it connects easily to
the DDW model.  With the query-first model we'd need some sort of
extension here, not really sure what it should look like.



Then, there's handling existing qemu (or other software) that is using
the VFIO SPAPR_TCE interfaces.  First, it's not entirely clear if this
should be a goal or not: as others have noted, working actively to
port qemu to the new interface at the same time as making a
comprehensive in-kernel compat layer is arguably redundant work.

That said, if we did want to handle this in an in-kernel compat layer,
here's roughly what you'd need for SPAPR_TCE v2:

- VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_GET_INFO
    I think this should be fairly straightforward; the information you
    need should be in the now generic IOVA window stuff and would just
    need massaging into the expected format.
- VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_REGISTER_MEMORY /
  VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_UNREGISTER_MEMORY
    IIUC, these could be traslated into map/unmap operations onto a
    second implicit IOAS which represents the preregistered memory
    areas (to which we'd never connect an actual device).  Along with
    this VFIO_MAP and VFIO_UNMAP operations would need to check for
    this case, verify their addresses against the preregistered space
    and be translated into IOAS_COPY operations from the prereg
    address space instead of raw IOAS_MAP operations.  Fiddly, but not
    fundamentally hard, I think.

For SPAPR_TCE_v1 things are a bit trickier

- VFIO_IOMMU_ENABLE/VFIO_IOMMU_DISABLE
    I suspect you could get away with implementing these as no-ops.
    It wouldn't be strictly correct, but I think software which is
    using the interface correctly should work this way, though
    possibly not optimally.  That might be good enough for this ugly
    old interface.

And... then there's VFIO_EEH_PE_OP.  It's very hard to know what to do
with this because the interface was completely broken for most of its
lifetime.  EEH is a fancy error handling feature of IBM PCI hardware
somewhat similar in concept, though not interface, to PCIe AER.  I have
a very strong impression that while this was a much-touted checkbox
feature for RAS, no-one, ever. actually used it.  As evidenced by the
fact that there was, I believe over a *decade* in which all the
interfaces were completely broken by design, and apparently no-one
noticed.

So, cynically, you could probably get away with making this a no-op as
well.  If you wanted to do it properly... well... that would require
training up yet another person to actually understand this and hoping
they get it done before they run screaming.  This one gets very ugly
because the EEH operations have to operate on the hardware (or
firmware) "Partitionable Endpoints" (PEs) which correspond one to one
with IOMMU groups, but not necessarily with VFIO containers, but
there's not really any sensible way to expose that to users.

You might be able to do this by simply failing this outright if
there's anything other than exactly one IOMMU group bound to the
container / IOAS (which I think might be what VFIO itself does now).
Handling that with a device centric API gets somewhat fiddlier, of
course.
