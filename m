Yes. Each a address spaces is an IOMMU group.

Thanks very much for your review.

Sorry for here. I forgot a thing here. that interface above still will
not be helpful. If we don't divide the whole 16GB ranges into 4
regions(let all the other ranges be dynamical), It won't work since we
can only adjust bank_sel with the larb as unit. This is a problem. there
are many ports in a larb. Take a example, the address for vcodec read
port is 32bits while the address for vcodec write port is 33bit, then it
will fail since we only have one bank_sel setting for one larb. Thus we
have to use current design.

Oh. In the code (patch [32/33] of v6), I put CCU0/1 in the cam/mdp
region which start at 8G since CCU0/1 is a module of camera.

About the conflict, I use patch [29/33] of v6 for this. I will reserve
this special iova region when the full domain(0-4G in this example)
initialize.

> Should perhaps disp be assigned 12G ~ 16G instead?

I think no need put it to 12G-16G, In previous SoC, we have only 4GB
ranges for whole MM engines. currently only cam/mdp domain exclude 128M
for CCU. it should be something wrong if this is not enough.
