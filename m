Hi Joerg,

> Presently, the default domain of a group is allocated during boot time and it
> cannot be changed later. So, the device would typically be either in identity
> (pass_through) mode or the device would be in DMA mode as long as the system
> is up and running. There is no way to change the default domain type
> dynamically i.e. after booting, a device cannot switch between identity mode
> and DMA mode.
> 
> Assume a use case wherein the privileged user would want to use the device in
> pass-through mode when the device is used for host so that it would be high
> performing. Presently, this is not supported. Hence add support to change the
> default domain of a group dynamically.
> 
> Support this through a sysfs file, namely
> "/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/<grp_id>/type".
> 
> Hi Joerg,
> Sorry! for _huge_ delay in posting a V2 of this patch set. Was stuck with some
> internal PoC work. Will be consistent from now.
> 
> Changes from V1:
> ----------------
> 1. V1 patch set wasn't updating dma_ops for some vendors (Eg: AMD), hence,
>    change the logic of updating default domain as below (because adding a
> device
>    to iommu_group automatically updates dma_ops)
>    a. Allocate a new domain
>    b. For every device in the group
> 	i. Remove the device from the group
> 	ii. Add the device back to the group
>    c. Free previous domain
> 2. Drop 1st patch of V1 (iommu/vt-d: Modify device_def_domain_type() to use
> at
>    runtime) because "iommu=pt" has no effect on this function anymore.
> 3. Added a patch to take/release lock while reading iommu_group-
> >default_domain->type
>    because it can be changed any time by user.
> 4. Before changing default domain type of a group, check if the group is
>    directly assigned for user level access. If so, abort.
> 5. Sanitize return path (using ternary operator) in iommu_group_store_type() 6.
> Split 2nd patch of V1 (iommu: Add device_def_domain_type() call back function
>    to iommu_ops) into two patches such that iommu generic changes are now in
> 1st
>    patch of V2 and vt-d specific changes are in 2nd patch of V2.
> 7. Rename device_def_domain_type() to dev_def_domain_type() 8. Remove
> example from documentation 9. Change the value written to file
> "/sys/kernel/iommu_groups/<grp_id>/type"
>    from "dma" to "DMA".

Just a gentle reminder, could you please review this patch set and let me know your comments?

Regards,
Sai
