Cheers.

There's also a case where swiotlb is forced (swiotlb=force) but restricted
DMA pools have been sized and allocated for individual devices in the DT.
In this case, having the guest fallback to the default shared swiotlb
buffer is better than failing the probe if CONFIG_DMA_RESTRICTED_POOL=n.
