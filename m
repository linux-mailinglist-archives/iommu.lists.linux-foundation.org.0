Your ecap register reports bit 7 (Snoop Control) set, which should mean
that VT-d is enforcing coherency regardless of no-snoop transactions.
I suspect maybe the different result from the ioctl could be from
testing this extension before the IOMMU has been set for the
container(?)

There's also bit 11 (Enable No Snoop) that could be cleared in the PCI
device control register, which would theoretically prevent the device
from using no-snoop TLPs.

Which DMAR?  Like this for example:

$ readlink -f /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:04:00.0/iommu
/sys/devices/virtual/iommu/dmar3

Your listing of devices piped to wc would also reciprocally list the
device in that output.  With 24 devices there's a fair chance that
dmar0 is the only one used.

Single socket Xeon processors like this tend to share more similarities
to consumer desktop processors than to the "Scalable" line of Xeons.

FWIW, there's a proposal[1] for a new, shared userspace IOMMU interface
that includes an option for the kernel to allocate IOVAs for these
cases.

If we assume the previous mapping was for 8KB and the new mapping was
for 12KB, I might hypothesize that the extent of the IOTLB invalidation
when unmapping the 8KB mapping could have an off-by-one such that the
IOMMU has a stale entry for the 2nd page.  The 1st page would have been
invalidated correctly and the behavior of the 3rd page might depend on
where it fell in the mapping previously, and arbitrary pressures on the
IOTLB otherwise.

And that would also avoid a large number of IOTLB invalidation issues.

Probably not, but I would be interested whether the results are more
consistent if you were to call MAP_DMA for each page rather than for
the whole buffer.  This would result in UNMAP_DMA across the whole IOVA
range of the buffer making individual unmaps for each page from the
IOMMU, which may point to something like the hypothesis above.

Yikes!  Thanks, and I'll be curious if breaking down the DMA_MAP calls
give us any further leads,
