Cheers, John. For interest, how do things look if you pass iommu.strict=0?
That might give some indication about how much the invalidation is still

In principle, I'm supportive of such a change, but I'm not currently able
to test any ATS stuff so somebody else would need to write the patch.
Jean-Philippe is on holiday at the moment, but I'd be happy to review
