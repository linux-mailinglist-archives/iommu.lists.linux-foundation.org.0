A possible way to do some chip-specific configuration would be setting smmu->options according to model ID:

static void acpi_smmu_get_options(u32 model, struct arm_smmu_device *smmu)
{
	switch (model) {
	case ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_CAVIUM_CN99XX:
		smmu->options |= ARM_SMMU_OPT_PAGE0_REGS_ONLY;
		break;
	case ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_HISILICON_HI161X:
		smmu->options |= ARM_SMMU_OPT_SKIP_PREFETCH;
		break;
+	case ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_HISILICON_HI162X:
+		smmu->options |= ARM_SMMU_OPT_DISABLE_MSIPOLL;
+		break;
	}

	dev_notice(smmu->dev, "option mask 0x%x\n", smmu->options);
}

I dumped the model id, but unluckily the id is just zero.

#define ACPI_IORT_SMMU_V3_GENERIC           0x00000000	/* Generic SMMUv3 */

Robin, 
would you like to think applying for a new model ID is a right way to set this chip-specific option?

Thanks
Barry
