As David already explained, the device does not have to access encrypted
memory. In fact, we don't have memory encryption but memory protection on
s390. All the device *should* ever see is non-protected memory (one that
was previously shared by the guest).

Our protected guests start as non-protected ones, and may or may not
turn protected during their life-span. From the device perspective,
really, nothing changes. I believe David explained this much better than
I did.

Halil
