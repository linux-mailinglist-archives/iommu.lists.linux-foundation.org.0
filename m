Personally, I'm not a huge fan of an implicit default for something
inherently architecture-dependent like this at all. What I'd like to
see is a mechanism that forces architecture code to explicitly
opt in to the default pgprot settings if they don't provide an
implementation of arch_dma_mmap_pgprot. This could perhaps be done
by reversing ARCH_HAS_DMA_MMAP_PGPROT to something like
ARCH_USE_DEFAULT_DMA_MMAP_PGPROT.

This way as more systems are moved to use the common mmap code instead
of their ops->mmap, the people doing the refactoring have to make an
explicit decision about the pgprot settings to use. Such a configuration
would have likely prevented this situation with powerpc from happening.

That being said, if the default behavior doesn't make sense in the
general case it should probably be fixed as well.

Curious to hear some thoughts on this.
