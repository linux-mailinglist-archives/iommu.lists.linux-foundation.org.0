So why not just fix that actual bug?

There are more DMA API backends than just dma-direct, so while this 
might help paper over bugs when SWIOTLB is in use, it's not going to 
have any effect when those same bugs are hit under other circumstances. 
Once again, the moral of the story is that effort is better spent just 
fixing the bugs ;)
