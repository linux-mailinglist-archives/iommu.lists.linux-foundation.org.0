Right, in the short term there will need to be compatibility through
the vfio groupfd as used by the kvm-vfio device and that should attempt
to approximate the narrowest reporting of potential non-coherent DMA,
ideally only 3, but acceptable equivalence for 3/4.

Long term, I'd expect the kvm-vfio device to transition to ioasidfd as
well.

Yes, the user should have control to define an IOASID that does not
enforce coherency by the IOMMU.  The value of disabling KVM wbinvd
emulation (3->4) needs to be justified, but there's no opposition to
extending existing KVM ioctls to providing that emulate-pause/resume
switch.

Yes.

>   /dev/ioasid);

Same as 2 above, but yes.  There are probably several opens here
regarding the user granularity of IOMMU coherence, ex. is it defined at
the IOASID or per mapping?  If not per mapping, how is it enforced for
user owned page tables?  The map/unmap interface could simply follow an
IOASID creation attribute to maintain ioctl compatibility with type1.

The device handle is from vfio though, right?  I'd think this would be
a capability on the VFIO_DEVICE_GET_INFO ioctl, where for PCI,
non-coherent is simply the result of probing that Enable No-snoop is
already or can be enabled (not hardwired zero).

kvm_vfio_group_is_coherent() would require either IOMMU enforced
coherence or all devices in the group to be coherent, the latter
allowing box 4 in the matrix to make wbinvd a no-op.

It seems like the "kernel policy" is specific to vfio compatibility.
The native IOASID API should allow the user to specify.

Yes, and vfio code emulating type1 via IOASID would need to create a
separate IOASID.

Both this and the previous are assuming the coherence is defined at the
IOASID rather than per mapping, I think we need to decide if that's the
case.

Yes, vfio will need some way to know whether the IOASID is operating in
boxes 3/4 (or better just 3).  Also, since coherence is the product of
device configuration rather than group configuration, we'll likely need
new mechanisms to keep the KVM view correct.  Thanks,

Alex
