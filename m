If a common operation is worth optimising anywhere, then it deserves optimising everywhere, so we end up with a dozen diverging copies of essentially the same code - particularly when the driver-specific functionality *is* already in the drivers, so what gets duplicated is solely the "generic" parts.

Probably we could introduce an iommu_ops->map/unmap_range() callback and
let the iommu driver to select "one call per page" map() or simply map a
range in a loop.

Some IOMMU drivers - mainly intel-iommu, as it happens - are already implementing hacks around the "one call per page" interface being inherently inefficient, so the logical thing to do here is take a step back and reconsider the fundamental design of the whole map/unmap interface. Implementing hacks on top of hacks to make particular things faster on particular systems that particular people care about is not going to do us any favours in the long run.
