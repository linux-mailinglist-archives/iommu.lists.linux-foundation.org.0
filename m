What's the path?  And does that path make sense?

I got this far before giving up:

    iommu_go_to_state                           # AMD
      state_next
        amd_iommu_init_pci
          amd_iommu_init_api
            bus_set_iommu
              iommu_bus_init
                bus_for_each_dev(..., add_iommu_group)
                  add_iommu_group
                    iommu_probe_device
                      amd_iommu_add_device                      # amd_iommu_ops.add_device
                        init_iommu_group
                          iommu_group_get_for_dev
                            iommu_group_add_device
                              __iommu_attach_device
                                amd_iommu_attach_device         # amd_iommu_ops.attach_dev
                                  attach_device                 # amd_iommu
                                    pdev_iommuv2_enable
                                      pci_enable_pri


    iommu_probe_device
      intel_iommu_add_device                    # intel_iommu_ops.add_device
        domain_add_dev_info
          dmar_insert_one_dev_info
            domain_context_mapping
              domain_context_mapping_one
                iommu_enable_dev_iotlb
                  pci_enable_pri


These *look* like enumeration paths, not DMA setup paths.  But I could
be wrong, since I gave up before getting to the source.

I don't want to add all this complexity because we *think* we need it.
I want to think about whether it makes *sense*.  Maybe it's sensible
for the PF enumeration or a PF driver to enable the hardware it owns.

If we leave it to the VFs, then we have issues with coordinating
between VFs that want different settings, etc.

If we understand the whole picture and it needs to be in the VFs,
that's fine.  But I don't think we understand the whole picture yet.
