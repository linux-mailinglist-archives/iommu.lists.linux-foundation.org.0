I'm not seeing that that's necessarily a problem.

I have to admit I haven't fully grasped the differences between these
modes.  I'm hoping we can consolidate at least some of them into the
same sort of binding onto different IOASIDs (which may be linked in
parent/child relationships).

I thought userspace selected the binding mode - although not all modes
will be possible for all devices.

Sounds like it.  What do you propose instead to handle backwards
compatibility for group-based VFIO code?

Uhhhh... I don't see how that can be.  They could well be in the same
group because their RIDs cannot be distinguished from each other.
