Right, that's the one downside of going for the minimalist "io-pgtable 
doesn't even have to know" approach. On reflection, though, in that 
paradigm it should probably be the caller's responsibility to convert 
TTBR1 addresses to preserve the "as if TTBR0" illusion anyway :/

The advantage of not having a quirk is that it allows split address 
spaces to fit more closely with the aux_domain idea, i.e. we could 
allocate and initialise a domain without having to assume, or even care, 
whether it will end up attached as a primary or aux domain. It *might* 
even be potentially useful to have a domain attached to TTBR0 of one 
device's context and TTBR1 of another's at the same time, although 
that's pretty niche.

Robin.
