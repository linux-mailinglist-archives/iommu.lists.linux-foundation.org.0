Mad as it looks, this does in fact capture the existing behaviour. What 
we've consolidated here was previously a weird mix of driver- and 
subsystem-level controls, and it is specifically those two drivers which 
have a long-standing expectation of using lazy behaviour by default.

We could certainly express it as "default IOMMU_DEFAULT_DMA_LAZY if X86" 
if people would prefer - virtio-iommu doesn't support lazy mode either 
way, so the end result will still be equivalent.
