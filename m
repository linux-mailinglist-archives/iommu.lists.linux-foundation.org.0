Could you point to me the SVA UAPI? I couldn't find it in the mainline.
Seems VDPA uses VHOST interface?

I still don't see why bare metal DPDK needs to get a handle of the
PASID. Perhaps the SVA patch would explain. Or are you talking about
vDPA DPDK process that is used to support virtio-net-pmd in the guest?

Not really nothing in terms of PASID life cycles. For example, if user
uses uacce interface to open an accelerator, it gets an FD_acc. Then it
opens /dev/sva to allocate PASID then get another FD_pasid. Then we
pass FD_pasid to the driver to bind page tables, perhaps multiple
drivers. Now we have to worry about If FD_pasid gets closed before
FD_acc(s) closed and all these race conditions.

If we do not expose FD_pasid to the user, the teardown is much simpler
and streamlined. Following each FD_acc close, PASID unbind is performed.
