TBH it's more of a conceptual cleanliness thing than a significant 
practical concern, but if we *are* breaking out a separate "validate the 
source elements" step then it does seem logical to capture everything 
relevant at once.

Realistically, creating a scatterlist segment pointing to the stack at 
all would already be quite an audacious feat of brokenness, but getting 
a random stack page in the middle of a segment would seem to imply 
something having gone so catastrophically wrong that it's destined to 
end very badly whether or not dma-debug squawks about it - not to 
mention getting lucky enough for said random stack page to actually 
belong to the current task stack in the first place :)
