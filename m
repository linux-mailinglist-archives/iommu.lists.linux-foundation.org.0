It's really not that bad.  The case of emulating the PAPR vIOMMU on
something else is relatively easy, because all updates to the IO page
tables go through hypercalls.  So, as long as the backend IOMMU can
map all the IOVAs that the guest IOMMU can, then qemu's implementation
of those hypercalls just needs to put an equivalent mapping in the
backend, which it can do with a generic VFIO_DMA_MAP.

vIOMMUs with page tables in guest memory are harder, but only really
in the usual ways that a vIOMMU of that type is harder (needs cache
mode or whatever).  At whatever point you need to shadow from the
guest IO page tables to the host backend, you can again do that with
generic maps, as long as the backend supports the necessary IOVAs, and
has an IO page size that's equal to or a submultiple of the vIOMMU
page size.

Maybe not every one, but I think we can get a pretty wide range with a
reasonable interface.  Explicitly handling IOVA windows does most of
it.  And we kind of need to handle that anyway to expose what ranges
the IOMMU is capable of translating anyway.  I think making handling
valid IOVA windows explicit makes things simpler than having
per-backend-family interfaces to expose the limits of their
translation ranges, which is what's likely to happen without it.
