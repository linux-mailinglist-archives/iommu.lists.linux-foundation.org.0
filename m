So I tested for iommu/cmdq for NVMe only, and I see:

	 !SMMU		5.3-rc4 strict/!strict	cmdq strict/!strict
D05 NVMe 750K IOPS	456K/540K IOPS		466K/537K
D06 NVMe 750K IOPS	456K/740K IOPS		466K/745K

I don't know why the D06 iommu.strict performance is ~ same as D05, 
while !strict is so much better. D06 SMMU implementation is supposed to 
be generally much better than that of D05, so I would have thought that 
the strict performance would be better (than that of D05).

Unfortunately I don't have anything ATS-enabled either. Not many do, it 
seems.
