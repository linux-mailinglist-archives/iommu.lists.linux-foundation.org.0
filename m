It shouldn't be a problem to hook something else up to the IOMMU
subsystem. Hopefully it's something that people are going to standardize
on.

I'm not sure I understand this issue. Is the context bank hard-coded in
the firmware somehow? Or is it possible to rewrite which one is going to
be used at runtime? Do you switch out the actual page tables rather than
the IOMMU domains for context switching?

You're comparing apples to oranges here. On x86 at least there was some
standardization when Linux started, whereas we still don't really have
that on ARM after so many years of efforts to standardize. I think we
are slowly getting there, but this particular instance shows that we're
not there yet.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say that we should just ignore
everything that's out there just because it may not be the way we want
it to be. On the other hand if we just take everything as-is and try to
implement workarounds and quirks every step of the way that's going to
also take away a lot of the resources that are already pretty scarce as
it is. I think it needs to be a reasonable compromise.

Also, there doesn't really seem to be a standardizing force in the Linux
on ARM world, so who's going to do that if not the Linux community?
