I think there's certainly a DT aspect to it so that the driver knows that
the SoC is hooked up this way, but I agree that we need a consumer so that
we can figure out how dynamic this needs to be. If it's just a
fire-and-forget thing then it needn't escape the IOMMU layer, but I fear
that it's probably more flexible than that.

If nothing shows up for 5.6, I'll send a patch to remove it (since Jordan
said there was something coming soon [1])
