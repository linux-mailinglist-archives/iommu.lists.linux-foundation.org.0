Okay. Still, divide by 10 happens to work, but it is very much not
obvious. It also doesn't work for level 1 and 16 or 64KB pages (though
we'll never see that granule). Subtracting 3 is not that obvious
either, but is at least in the spec for calculating the bits per
level.

I think we've spent enough time micro-optimizing this and have better
things to worry about.
