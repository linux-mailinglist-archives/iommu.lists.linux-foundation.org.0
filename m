The other option is to say, VFIO would never emulate these
fake capablities. If exposing a VF with PASID/PRI is required
the PF driver would simply wrap it into a VDCM like model which we do
today for Scalable IOV devices. So PF handles all aspects of this
interface.

I also like the suggestion you propose, maybe an offset where these
capabilities are exposed to VF's. Maybe have an architected DEVCAPx
which exposes these RO capabilities. No control, and the 
offset should be preserved by the SIG, so VMM can have a safe place
to stash them.

Even if we ask SIG for clarification, it might affect today's devices
So might not be useful to solve our current situation.
