Also, I'll add to that, a big wish of mine is to have stall with the
ability to resume later from a wq context.  That would enable me to
hook in the gpu crash dump handling for faults, which would make
debugging these sorts of issues much easier.  I think I posted a
prototype of this quite some time back, which would schedule a worker
on the first fault (since there are cases where you see 1000's of
faults at once), which grabbed some information about the currently
executing submit and some gpu registers to indicate *where* in the
submit (a single submit could have 100's or 1000's of draws), and then
resumed the iommu cb.

(This would ofc eventually be useful for svm type things.. I expect
we'll eventually care about that too.)
