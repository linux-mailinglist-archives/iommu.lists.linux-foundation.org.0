...is implicitly that. Sorry that it's not obvious.

The "proper" flow is that iommu_probe_device() is called for everything 
which already exists during the IOMMU driver's own probe when it calls 
bus_set_iommu(), then at BUS_NOTIFY_ADD_DEVICE time for everything which 
appears subsequently. The only trouble is, to observe it in action on a 
DT-based system you'd currently have to go back at least 4 years, before 
09515ef5ddad...

Basically there were two issues: firstly we need the of_xlate step 
before add_device (now probe_device) for a DT-based IOMMU driver to know 
whether it should care about the given device or not. When -EPROBE_DEFER 
was the only tool we had to ensure probe ordering, and resolving the 
"iommus" DT property the only place to decide that, delaying it all 
until driver probe time was the only reasonable option, however ugly. 
The iommu_probe_device() "replay" in {of,acpi}_iommu_configure() is 
merely doing its best to fake up the previous behaviour. Try binding a 
dummy driver to your device first, then unbind it and bind the real one, 
and you'll see that iommu_probe_device() doesn't run the second or 
subsequent times. Now that we have fw_devlink to take care of ordering, 
the main reason for this weirdness is largely gone, so I'm keen to start 
getting rid of the divergence again as far as possible. Fundamentally, 
IOMMU drivers are supposed to be aware of all devices which the kernel 
knows about, regardless of whether they have a driver available or not.

The second issue is that when we have multiple IOMMU instances, the 
initial bus_set_iommu() "replay" is only useful for the first instance, 
so devices managed by other instances which aren't up and running yet 
will be glossed over. Currently this ends up being papered over by the 
solution to the first point on DT systems, while the x86 drivers hide 
their individual IOMMU units behind a single IOMMU API "instance", so 
it's been having little impact in practice. However, improving the core 
API's multi-instance support is an increasingly pressing issue now that 
new more varied systems are showing up, and it's that which is really 
going to be driving the aforementioned changes. FWIW the plan I 
currently have is to hang things off iommu_device_register() instead.

That's fair enough - TBH the current sysfs interface is a pretty 
specialist sport primarily for datacentre folks who can afford to take 
down their 40GBE NIC or whatever momentarily for a longer-term payoff, 
but it was worth exploring - I'm assuming the SDHCI holds your root 
filesystem so you wouldn't be able to do the unbinding dance from real 
userspace. As I said, the idea of embedding any sort of data in 
individual client drivers is a non-starter in general since it only has 
any hope of working on DT platforms (maybe arm64 ACPI too?), and only 
for very much the wrong reasons.

If this is something primarily demanded by QCom platforms in the short 
term, I'm tempted to say just try it with more device-matching magic in 
arm-smmu-qcom. Otherwise, the idea of growing the sysfs interface to 
allow switching a DMA domain from default-strict to non-strict is 
certainly an interesting prospect. Going a step beyond that to bring up 
a flush queue 'live' without rebuilding the whole group and domain could 
get ugly when it comes to drivers' interaction with io-pgtable, but I 
think it might be *technically* feasible...

Robin.
