Well, the comment could effectively just be "New drivers should support 
default domains."

What supporting default domains means in practice is two things: that 
.attach_dev handles moving directly between domains without .detach_dev 
being called, and that .domain_alloc supports at least IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA 
- other unsupported default domain types can fall back to that, but not 
vice versa, see iommu_group_alloc_default_domain().

Historically, whatever a NULL domain means is mostly between the IOMMU 
driver and the platform DMA ops - I honestly have no idea what the likes 
of s390 and fsl-pamu do, for example. For SMMUv3 it was always configurable.

Cheers,
Robin.
