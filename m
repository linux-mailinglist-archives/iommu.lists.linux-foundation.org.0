It will have to and that's what we are working on.

We don't merge code based on assumptions that can easily break because
the specifications don't contemplate the details that are required.

See above. We don't merge code that we know can break and is based on
assumptions, we need to update the IORT specifications to make them
cover all the use cases - in a predictable way - and that's what we are
working on.

I answered above - if you have any questions please ask them, here,
as far as Linux code is concerned.

I understand this is taking a long time, it is also helping us
understand all the possible use cases and how to cover them in
a way that is maintainable in the long run.
