Not only. Imagine this:

a) Without bouncing:

- RX interrupt
- Pass the packet to the network stack
- Network stack validates the packet
- DMA overwrites the packet
- Network stack goes boom, because the packet changed after validation

b) With bouncing:

- RX interrupt
- Copy the packet to a DMA-inaccessible buffer
- Network stack validates the packet
- Network stack is happy, because the packet is guaranteed to stay the
same after validation

Best regards,
Tomasz
