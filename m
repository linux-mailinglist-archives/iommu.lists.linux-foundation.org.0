They're "standalone" in the sense that they don't have to be part of an 
SMMU, they could be part of a PCIe root complex or other SoC device that 
couples to an SMMU (e.g. anything that can speak AMBA DTI, in the case 
of our SMMU implementations).

In fact our SMMU TBUs are pretty much separate devices themselves, they 
just *only* speak DTI, so access to their registers is proxied through 
the TCU programming interface.

Being a child of its associated device doesn't seem too bad 
semantically, however how would we describe a PMCG as a child of a PCIe 
node when its "reg" property still exists in the parent address space 
and not PCI config/memory space like any of its siblings? Also in 
practical terms, consuming that binding in Linux and getting the things 
to probe when it may want to be independent of whether we even 
understand the parent node at all could be... unpleasant.
