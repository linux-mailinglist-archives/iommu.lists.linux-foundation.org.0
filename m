I see it more like, given that we already know we have multiple users
of IOMMU, adding new IOMMU focused features has to gravitate toward
some kind of convergance.

Currently things are not so bad, VDPA is just getting started and the
current IOMMU feature set is not so big.

PASID/vIOMMU/etc/et are all stressing this more, I think the
responsibility falls to the people proposing these features to do the
architecture work.

I don't think it is "held hostage" it is a "no shortcuts" approach,
there was always a recognition that future VDPA drivers will need some
work to integrated with vIOMMU realted stuff.

This is no different than the IMS discussion. The first proposed patch
was really simple, but a layering violation.

The correct solution was some wild 20 patch series modernizing how x86
interrupts works because it had outgrown itself. This general approach
to use the shared MSI infrastructure was pointed out at the very
beginning of IMS, BTW.
