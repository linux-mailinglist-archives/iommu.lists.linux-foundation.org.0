It has been shown that the cmpxchg() for finding space in the cmdq can
be a real bottleneck:
- for more CPUs contending the cmdq, the cmpxchg() will fail more often
- since the software-maintained cons pointer is updated on the same 64b
  memory region, the chance of cmpxchg() failure increases again

The cmpxchg() is removed as part of 2 related changes:

- Update prod and cmdq owner in a single atomic add operation. For this, we
  count the prod and owner in separate regions in prod memory.

  As with simple binary counting, once the prod+wrap fields overflow, they
  will zero. They should never overflow into "owner" region, and we zero
  the non-owner, prod region for each owner. This maintains the prod
  pointer.

  As for the "owner", we now count this value, instead of setting a flag.
  Similar to before, once the owner has finished gathering, it will clear
  a mask. As such, a CPU declares itself as the "owner" when it reads zero
  for this region. This zeroing will also clear possible overflow in
  wrap+prod region, above.

  The owner is now responsible for cmdq locking to avoid possible deadlock.
  The owner will lock the cmdq for all non-owers it has gathered when they
  have space in the queue and have written their entries.

- Check for space in the cmdq after the prod pointer has been assigned.

  We don't bother checking for space in the cmdq before assigning the prod
  pointer, as this would be racy.

  So since the prod pointer is updated unconditionally, it would be common
  for no space to be available in the cmdq when prod is assigned - that
  is, according the software-maintained prod and cons pointer. So now
  it must be ensured that the entries are not yet written and not until
  there is space.

  How the prod pointer is maintained also leads to a strange condition
  where the prod pointer can wrap past the cons pointer. We can detect this
  condition, and report no space here. However, a prod pointer progressed
  twice past the cons pointer cannot be detected. But it can be ensured that
  this that this scenario does not occur, as we limit the amount of
  commands any CPU can issue at any given time, such that we cannot
  progress prod pointer further.
