Right, and it's still not really clear to me what devices connected to
the same /dev/iommu instance really need to have in common, as
distinct from what devices connected to the same specific ioasid need
to have in common.

Well, you can't attach a device to an individual IOASID unless all
devices in its group are attached to the same individual IOASID
either, so I'm not clear what benefit there is to enforcing it at the
/dev/iommu instance as well as at the individual ioasid level.

I agree.  But the question is what's *not* possible to be per-IOASID,
so what's the semantic boundary that defines when things have to be in
the same /dev/iommu instance, but not the same IOASID.

No, not always, only sometimes.  The host side IOVA has to be able to
process all the IOVAs that the guest might generate, and it needs to
have an equal or smaller pagesize than the guest expects.
