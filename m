No, I don't think so.  In fact the way I was envisaging this,
non-FIXED mappings will *never* go into the reserved ranges.  This is
for the benefit of any use cases that need both mappings where they
don't care about the IOVA and those which do.

Essentially, reserving a region here is saying to the kernel "I want
to manage this IOVA space; make sure nothing else touches it".  That
means both that the kernel must disallow any hw associated changes
(like ATTACH) which would impinge on the reserved region, and also any
IOVA allocations that would take parts away from that space.

Whether we want to restrict FIXED mappings to the reserved regions is
an interesting question.  I wasn't thinking that would be necessary
(just as you can use mmap() MAP_FIXED anywhere).  However.. much as
MAP_FIXED is very dangerous to use if you don't previously reserve
address space, I think IOMAP_FIXED is dangerous if you haven't
previously reserved space.  So maybe it would make sense to only allow
FIXED mappings within reserved regions.

Strictly dividing the IOVA space into kernel managed and user managed
regions does make a certain amount of sense.

Right.  With the revised model where reserving windows is optional,
not required, I don't think we can quite re-use this for optimization
hints.  Which is a bit unfortunate.

I can't immediately see a way to tweak this which handles both more
neatly, but I like the idea if we can figure out a way.

That was a somewhat simplified description.  When we look in more
detail, I think the ppc and x86 models become more similar.  So, in
more detail, I think it would look like this:

1. Create base IOAS
2. Map guest memory into base IOAS so that IOVA=3D=3DGPA
3. Create IOASes for each vIOMMU domain
4. Reserve windows in domain IOASes where the vIOMMU will allow
   mappings by default
5. ATTACH devices to appropriate IOASes (***)
6. Boot the guest

  On guest map/invalidate:
        Use IOAS_COPY to take mappings from base IOAS and put them
	into the domain IOAS
  On memory hotplug:
        IOAS_MAP new memory block into base IOAS
  On dev hotplug: (***)
        ATTACH devices to appropriate IOAS
  On guest reconfiguration of vIOMMU domains (x86 only):
        DETACH device from base IOAS, attach to vIOMMU domain IOAS
  On guest reconfiguration of vIOMMU apertures (ppc only):
        Alter reserved regions to match vIOMMU

The difference between ppc and x86 is at the places marked (***):
which IOAS each device gets attached to and when. For x86 all devices
live in the base IOAS by default, and only get moved to domain IOASes
when those domains are set up in the vIOMMU.  For POWER each device
starts in a domain IOAS based on its guest PE, and never moves.

[This is still a bit simplified.  In practice, I imagine you'd
 optimize to only create the domain IOASes at the point
 they're needed - on boot for ppc, but only when the vIOMMU is
 configured for x86.  I don't think that really changes the model,
 though.]

A few aspects of the model interact quite nicely here.  Mapping a
large memory guest with IOVA=3D=3DGPA would probably fail on a ppc host
IOMMU.  But if both guest and host are ppc, then no devices get
attached to that base IOAS, so its apertures don't get restricted by
the host hardware.  That way we get a common model, and the benefits
of GUP sharing via IOAS_COPY, without it failing in the ppc-on-ppc
case.

x86-on-ppc and ppc-on-x86 will probably only work in limited cases
where the various sizes and windows line up, but the possibility isn't
precluded by the model or interfaces.
