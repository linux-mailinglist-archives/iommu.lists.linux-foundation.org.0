Note that ZONE_DMA32 is irrelevant in this particular case, as we are
talking about arm32.  But with ZONE_DMA instead this roughly makes sense.

zone_dma_bits is our somewhat ugly way to try to poke into this
information, although the way it is done right now sucks pretty badly.

The patch I sent to Peter in December was trying to convey that
information in a way similar to what the arm32 legacy dma code does, but
it didn't work, so I'll need to find some time to sit down and figure out
why.
