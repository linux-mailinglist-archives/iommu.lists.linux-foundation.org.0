Right, and in case 2 there should be no report printed since it can be
triggered by user, while you probably want to be loud in case 1.

This part I don't understand. So the SMMU sends a RESUME(abort) command,
and then the master reports the DMA error to the device driver, which
cannot differentiate 1 from 2?  (I guess there is no SSID in this report?)
But how does disabling stall change this?  The invalid DMA access will
still be aborted by the SMMU.

Hypothetically, would it work if all stall events that could not be
handled went to the device driver?  Those reports would contain the SSID
(or lack thereof), so you could reset the device in case 1 and ignore case
2. Though resetting the device in the middle of a stalled transaction
probably comes with its own set of problems.

I think disabling stall for CD0 of a DMA domain makes sense in general,
even though I don't really understand how that fixes your issue. But
someone might come up with a good use-case for receiving stall events on
DMA mappings, so I'm wondering whether the alternative solution where we
report unhandled stall events to the device driver would also work for
you.

Thanks,
Jean
