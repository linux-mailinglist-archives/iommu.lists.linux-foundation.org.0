But AFAICS the equivalent fallback path still has to exist either way. 
My impression so far is that callers would end up looking something like 
this:

	if (dma_pci_p2pdma_supported()) {
		if (dma_map_sg(...) < 0)
			//do non-p2p fallback due to p2p failure
	} else {
		//do non-p2p fallback due to lack of support
	}

at which point, simply:

	if (dma_map_sg_p2p(...) < 0)
		//do non-p2p fallback either way

seems entirely reasonable. What am I missing?

Let's not pretend that overloading an existing API means we can start 
feeding P2P pages into any old subsystem/driver without further changes 
- there already *are* at least some that retry ad infinitum if DMA 
mapping fails (the USB layer springs to mind...) and thus wouldn't 
handle the PCI_P2PDMA_MAP_NOT_SUPPORTED case acceptably.

Huh? I'm specifically suggesting a new interface that takes the *same* 
data structure (at least to begin with), but just gives us more 
flexibility in terms of introducing p2p-aware behaviour somewhat more 
safely. Yes, we already know that we ultimately want something better 
than scatterlists for representing things like this and dma-buf imports, 
but that hardly has to happen overnight.

Robin.
