Note that vfio does not currently require all devices in the group to
be bound to drivers.  Other devices within the group, those bound to
vfio drivers, can be used in this configuration.  This is not
necessarily recommended though as a non-vfio, non-stub driver binding
to one of those devices can trigger a BUG_ON.

The latter is user policy, yes, but it's a system security issue that
the user cannot use device A to control device B if the user doesn't
have access to both devices, ie. doesn't own the group.  vfio would
prevent this by not allowing access to device A while device B is
insecure and would require that all devices within the group remain in
a secure, user owned state for the extent of access to device A.

This is sane, yes, but that doesn't give us license to allow the user
to access device A regardless of the state of device B.

This is self contradictory, "vfio doesn't need to know the attachment
status"... "[a]s long as a device in a group either in block DMA or
switch to a new address space".  So vfio does need to know the latter.
How does it know that?  Thanks,

Alex
