I think it will address the issue I am facing as well. I will wait for 
your patch.

iommu_unmap() expects that all areas within unmap size are mapped. 
infact It
abandons further unmap if it find any chunk not mapped.  So if an IOMMU
implementation is not returning failure for already unmapped area,
then it's prone to issue where DMA API reuse the IOVA, which is already 
mapped.

In this case where iommu implementation returns error for already 
unmapped area,
currently there is no way to distinguish an unmap failure due to range 
already
unmapped or say while partially unmapping a section map, memory 
allocation fails
and thus unmap returns failure.
In second case, we will free the iova even with mapping present. And 
subsequent
dma mapping will keep on failing if it uses this freed iova. For managed 
iova
both unmap/map should be done with dma APIs, it should be safe to expect 
if a
range is unmapped with DMA APIs corresponding iova is also freed, so 
there
shouldn't be a real need to free iova where unmap fails due to range 
already
entirely unmapped.

I am not sure how useful is this freed iova if corresponding mappings 
are not
unmapped. We won't be able to use those iova. The subsequent iommu_map 
will fail
if using this freed iova. So it's important to ensure we only free iova 
which is
unmapped successfully.

Prakash
