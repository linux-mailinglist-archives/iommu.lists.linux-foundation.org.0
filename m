I'm not quite sure I'd agree, but certainly it could be up for debate.
I think I'm keeping full compatibility with the kernel command line
parameter, specifically:

* iommu.strict=0: default to non-strict mode unless a driver overrides

* iommu.strict=1: force everything to strict no matter what

...both of those two things are the same before and after my patchset.

You're arguing that I'm changing the behavior of the system when no
command line parameter is present. To me this seems a little bit of a
stretch. If no command line parameter is present I'd assert that the
kernel should do some sort of sane behavior and that we don't have to
force 100% strictness if the command line parameter isn't present at
all.

I would also note that your assertion that the system is 100% strict
under the "no command line parameter" case isn't actually true as far
as I can tell. The code in mainline is a little hard to follow (for me
the code after my patch is easier to follow), but you can see that
even before my patch a call to iommu_set_dma_strict() could be used to
make the system non-strict if no command-line parameter was passed.

I was really trying _not_ to do that. I believe this has been talked
about several times, including at last year's Linux Plumbers
conference. As far as I can tell it always ends in a shouting match w/
no forward progress. There are a bunch of problems here, namely:

* Trust isn't necessarily binary. There might be peripherals that you
sort-of trust, others that you really trust, and others that you don't
trust at all. For the ones you sort-of trust there may be some things
you trust about them and other things you don't trust about them.

* The firmware isn't necessarily the best arbitrar of trust. For
instance, if the company that employs me (Google) compiled their own
firmware for a given peripheral device and they were convinced that
the peripheral firmware couldn't be compromised any more easily than
code running in the kernel itself, they might assert that the
peripheral device should be "trusted". An individual Linux hacker,
however, might not really trust the firmware blob that Google provides
and might want the device to be "untrusted".

* In the PCI subsystem I believe that "trusted" vs "untrusted" is
generally associated with whether a device is soldered down onto the
board or in some type of slot (the "external" concept). That's been
working OK for them, I think, but I'm not convinced it'd be easy to
apply everywhere. One example problem: what do you do about SD cards?
The thing doing the DMA (the SDHCI controller) is certainly "internal"
but the cards are "external". I'm making the argument in my series
that SDHCI should be considered at least trusted enough to use
non-strict DMA, but it's still technically "external" and you wouldn't
necessarily, for instance, trust the filesystem structure not to be
crafted in a malicious way so as to exploit the kernel.

It's a function of the DMA device, but the entity in the kernel with
the most knowledge about this is the device's driver. The driver also
has the best ability to make informed decisions, perhaps looking at
the device's properties (like the "non-removable" one for SD/MMC) to
help make decisions without us having to create a new property to
describe trust and then argue about who sets it and when.
