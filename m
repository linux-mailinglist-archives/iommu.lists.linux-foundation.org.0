There's ARM SMMU, ARM SMMU v3 and at least FSL PAMU. Even some of the
x86 platforms use dev_is_pci() to special-case PCI devices. That's just
because PCI is fundamentally different from fixed devices such as those
on a platform bus.

See above, there are other cases where PCI devices are treated special.
For example, pretty much every driver that supports PCI differentiates
between PCI and other devices in their ->device_group() callback.

I don't really have any objections to doing something similar to what
ARM SMMU does. My main objection is to the use of a global pointer that
is used to look up the SMMU. As you see, the ARM SMMU driver also does
this lookup via driver_find_device_by_fwnode() rather than storing a
global pointer.

Also you can't quite equate ARM SMMU with Tegra SMMU. ARM SMMU can
properly deal with devices behind a PCI host bridge, whereas on Tegra
all those devices are thrown in the same bucket with the same IOMMU
domain. So it's to be expected that some things will have to be
different between the two drivers.

Have you also seen that sun50i-iommu does look up the SMMU from a
phandle using of_find_device_by_node()? So I think you've shown yourself
that even "modern" drivers avoid global pointers and look up via
phandle.
