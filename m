First things first:

Yoshihiro, can you try this git branch?  The new bits are just the three
patches at the end, but they sit on top of a few patches already sent
out to the list, so a branch is probably either:

   git://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git scsi-virt-boundary-fixes

Gitweb:

   http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/misc.git/shortlog/refs/heads/scsi-virt-boundary-fixes

And now on to the rest:

Ok, makes sense.

So based on the above I'm a little confused about the actual requirement
again.  Can you still split the SCSI command into multiple URBs?  And
is the boundary for that split still the scatterlist entry as in the
description above?  If so I don't really see how the virt_boundary
helps you at all. as it only guarnatees that in a bio, each subsequent
segment start as the advertised virt_boundary.  It says nothing about
the size of each segment.

Thay is someething the virt_boundary prevents.  But could still give
you something like:

	1536 4096 4096 1024

or
	1536 16384 8192 4096 16384 512

Thanks, taken into account in the above patches!
