Yeah, having figured out the history, I ended up with the opinion that 
it was a missed corner-case optimisation opportunity, rather than an 
actual error with respect to intent or implementation, so I 
intentionally left that out. Plus figuring out an exact Fixes tag might 
be tricky - as above I reckon it probably only started to become 
significant somwehere around 5.11 or so.

All of these various levels of retry mechanisms are only a best-effort 
thing, and ultimately if you're making large allocations from a small 
space there are always going to be *some* circumstances that still 
manage to defeat them. Over time, we've made them try harder, but that 
fact that we haven't yet made them try hard enough to work well for a 
particular use-case does not constitute a bug. However as Joerg says, 
anyone's welcome to make a case to Greg to backport a mainline commit if 
it's a low-risk change with significant benefit to real-world stable 
kernel users.

Thanks all!

Robin.
