Unfortunately, this doesn't work. In normal operation, the default 
domains should be established long before individual drivers are even 
loaded (if they are modules), let alone anywhere near probing. The fact 
that iommu_probe_device() sometimes gets called far too late off the 
back of driver probe is an unfortunate artefact of the original 
probe-deferral scheme, and causes other problems like potentially 
malformed groups - I've been forming a plan to fix that for a while now, 
so I for one really can't condone anything trying to rely on it. 
Non-deterministic behaviour based on driver probe order for multi-device 
groups is part of the existing problem, and your proposal seems equally 
vulnerable to that too.

FWIW we already have a go-faster knob for people who want to tweak the 
security/performance compromise for specific devices, namely the sysfs 
interface for changing a group's domain type before binding the relevant 
driver(s). Is that something you could use in your application, say from 
an initramfs script?

Thanks,
Robin.
