Hmm, I'm sure I had at least half-written a reply on that point, but I 
can't seem to find it now... anyway, the gist is that these inbound 
windows are generally set up to cover the physical address ranges of 
DRAM and anything else that devices might need to DMA to. Thus if you're 
not using an IOMMU, the fact that devices can't access the gaps in 
between doesn't matter because there won't be anything there anyway; it 
only needs mitigating if you do use an IOMMU and start giving arbitrary 
non-physical addresses to the endpoint.

This doesn't look like it will conflict with the other DMA ops and MSI 
mapping changes currently in-flight for iommu-dma, so I have no 
objection to it going through the PCI tree for 5.2.

Robin.
