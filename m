You are right, I was reading call_srcu comments too fast. I guess
rcu callbacks are still in softirq not offloaded to kernel threads.

 *
 * The callback will be invoked from process context, but must
 *  nevertheless be fast and must not block.

So even atomic works in principle but not a good idea since it may take
a long time.

OK. Not an option here :(

Might be the only option now.
