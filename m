That was not the only problem with existing code. Existing code also
assumed that add_flush and sync always go in pairs, but that's not
true.

My suggestion is to fix the locking in the driver and keep the sync
deferred as much as possible, so that performance is not degraded. I
changed my mind, though. I think we would need to make more changes to
the driver to make it implement the flushing efficiently, so let's go
with the current simple approach for now and improve incrementally.

Okay, let's do so as a first step to fix the issue. Then we can
optimize in follow up patches.

Okay, makes sense.
