I think my results would imply that we would have to end up with (at
least) some special case of your proposal (i.e. we need a context bank
allocated).

As described in my reply to your proposal, the one problem I ran into
was that I haven't figured out how to reliably "move" my display streams
from one mapping entry to another.

With the current scheme I see that their will either be gaps in time
with no mapping for my display, or multiple mappings.


The other thing I noticed in your proposal was that I have a whole bunch
of DT nodes with both iommus and memory-region properties that I really
don't care to set up mappings for, but I've not finalized my thoughts on
this causing actual problems...

For Qualcomm we got patches picked up for 5.8 that will cause the
display controller to be attached with direct mapping, so I think all
missing now is the lack of stream mappings between arm-smmu probe and
display driver probe...
