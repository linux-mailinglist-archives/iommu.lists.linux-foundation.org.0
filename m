I guess this thread has been silent for a bit of time now. Given that
my previous version generated a whole bunch of traffic, I guess I'm
assuming this:

a) Nothing is inherently broken with my current approach.

b) My current approach doesn't make anybody terribly upset even if
nobody is totally in love with it.

c) Nobody has any other bright ideas for ways to solve this that would
make my patch series obsolete.

I guess I'll take that as a good sign and hope that it means that this
approach has a path forward. I suppose it could just be that everyone
is busy and/or on vacation, but I've always been an optimist!

My plan continues to be to send a v3 of my patch series atop Sai's
patch [1] and John's series [2]. I'll plan to wait a bit longer before
posting my v3 to allow for more feedback/thoughts and also to see if
either Sai's patches or John's patches land and/or have newer versions
posted. :-)
