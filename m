I would assume that a *proper* warning would check if we see the
"non-coherent" case, e.g. by using dev_is_dma_coherent() and only
report with potentially fatal WARN on systems where it is appropriate.

However, I am certainly even less familiar with all that, and might
just have gotten the wrong impression here.

Also not sure about mlx5 relation here, it does not really show
in the call trace, only in the err_printk() output, probably
from dev_driver_string(dev) or dev_name(dev). But I do not see
where mlx5 code would be involved here.

Thanks, but I cannot really make a lot of sense out if this. Which
driver exactly would be the one that needs to take care of the
cache line alignment for sg elements? If this WARN is really reporting
a bug, could you please help pointing to where it would need to be
addressed?

And does this really say that it is illegal to have multiple sg elements
within the same cache line, regardless of cache coherence?

Adding linux-rdma@vger.kernel.org, sorry for the noise, but maybe somebody
on that list can make more sense of this.
