Uh.. what?  We certainly know (or, rather, choose) the IOVA ranges for
ppc.  That is to say we set up the default IOVA ranges at machine
construction (those defaults have changed with machine version a
couple of times).  If the guest uses dynamic DMA windows we then
update those ranges based on the hypercalls, but at any point we know
what the IOVA windows are supposed to be.  I don't really see how x86
or anything else could not know the IOVA ranges.  Who else *could* set
the ranges when implementing a vIOMMU in TCG mode?

For the non-vIOMMU case then IOVA=3D=3DGPA, so everything qemu knows about
the GPA space it also knows about the IOVA space.  Which, come to
think of it, means memory hotplug also complicates things.

I don't follow.  The problem for the qemu case here is if you hotplug
a device which narrows down the range to something smaller than the
guest expects.  If qemu has told the kernel the ranges it needs, that
can just fail (which is the best you can do).  If the kernel adds the
device but narrows the ranges, then you may have just put the guest
into a situation where the vIOMMU cannot do what the guest expects it
to.  If qemu can only query the windows, not specify them then it
won't know that adding a particular device will conflict with its
guest side requirements until after it's already added.  That could
mess up concurrent guest initiated map operations for existing devices
in the same guest side domain, so I don't think reversing the hotplug
after the problem is detected is enough.

I don't follow you.  Are you talking about the vIOMMU or non vIOMMU
case?  In the vIOMMU case the different containers can be for
different guest side iommu domains with different guest-IOVA spaces,
so you can't just copy from one to another.
