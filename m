A driver that knows how to use the device in a coherent way can
certainly proceed, but I suspect that's not something we can ask of
QEMU.  QEMU has no visibility to the in-use driver and sketchy ability
to virtualize the no-snoop enable bit to prevent non-coherent DMA from
the device.  There might be an experimental ("x-" prefixed) QEMU device
option to allow user override, but QEMU should disallow the possibility
of malfunctioning drivers by default.  If we have devices that probe as
supporting no-snoop, but actually can't generate such traffic, we might
need a quirk list somewhere.

You're suggesting that a user isn't forced to give up wbinvd emulation
if they lose access to their device?  I suspect that like we do today,
we'll want to re-evaluate the need for wbinvd on most device changes.
I think this is why the kvm-vfio device holds a vfio group reference;
to make sure a given group can't elevate privileges for multiple
processes.  Thanks,

Alex
