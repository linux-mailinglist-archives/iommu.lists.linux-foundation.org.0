Sorry, it's been insanely busy recently and I haven't had a chance to think
about this on top of everything else. We're also carrying a hack in Android
for you :)

I've had a chat with Robin about this. Originally, I was hoping that
people would all work together towards an idyllic future where firmware
would be able to describe arbitrary pre-existing mappings for devices,
irrespective of the IOMMU through which they master and Linux could
inherit this configuration. However, that hasn't materialised (there was
supposed to be an IORT update, but I don't know what happened to that)
and, in actual fact, the problem that you have on db845 is /far/ more
restricted than the general problem.

Could you please try hacking something along the following lines and see
how you get on? You may need my for-joerg/arm-smmu/updates branch for
all the pieces:

  1. Use the ->cfg_probe() callback to reserve the SMR/S2CRs you need
     "pinning" and configure for bypass.

  2. Use the ->def_domain_type() callback to return IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY
     for the display controller

I /think/ that's sufficient, but note that it differs from the current
approach because we don't end up reserving a CB -- bypass is configured
in the S2CR instead. Some invalidation might therefore be needed in
->cfg_probe() after unhooking the CB.

Thanks, and please yell if you run into problems with this approach.

Will
