Hi Sven,

The problem with both #1 and #2 is that you end up with two references
to (effectively) different iommu's in the dwc3 device node.  I don't
see how that is compatible with the idea of using a single translation
table for both sub-DARTs.

If you no longer think that is desirable, you'll still have the
problem that you'll need to modify the dwc3 driver code such that it
uses the right IOMMU to do its DMA address translation.  Given what
you write above that sounds really ugly and confusing.  I would
certainly want to avoid doing that in OpenBSD.

So I think #3 is the only realistic option here.  In my opinion it is
perfectly fine for the devicetree to present a workable model of the
hardware instead of a 100% accurate model.
