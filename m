The DMA API doesn't need locking, partly since it can trust itself not 
to do stupid things, and mostly because it's DMA API performance that's 
fundamentally incompatible with serialisation anyway. Why do you think 
we have a complicated per-CPU IOVA caching mechanism, if not to support 
big multi-queue devices with multiple CPU threads mapping/unmapping in 
different parts of the same DMA domain concurrently?

> Or at least it should be documented..

As far as I'm aware there's never been any restriction at the IOMMU API 
level. It should be self-evident that racing concurrent 
iommu_{map,unmap} requests against iommu_domain_free(), or against each 
other for overlapping IOVAs, is a bad idea and don't do that if you want 
a well-defined outcome. The simpler drivers already serialise on a 
per-domain lock internally, while the more performance-focused ones 
implement lock-free atomic pagetable management in a similar style to 
CPU arch code; either way it should work fine as-is. The difference with 
debugfs is that it's a completely orthogonal side-channel - an 
iommu_domain user like VFIO or iommu-dma can make sure its *own* API 
usage is sane, but can't be aware of the user triggering some 
driver-internal introspection of that domain in a manner that could race 
more harmfully. It has to be down to individual drivers to make that 
safe if they choose to expose such an interface.

Robin.
