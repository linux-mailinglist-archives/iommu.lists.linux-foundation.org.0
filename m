There will be no drivers for that, but an mdev is a container for
resources of a physical device which can be assigned to a virtual
machine or a user-space process. In this way it fits very well into the
existing abstractions.

Some points here:

	1) The concept of PASIDs is not limited to PCI devices.
	
	2) An mdev is not a restriction. It is an abstraction with which
	   other parts of the kernel can work.

You still have to convince me that this is needed and a good idea. By
now I am not even remotely convinced and putting words like 'fixing',
'clearly' and 'silly' in a sentence is by far not enough for this to
happen.

Passing an mm_struct to a device is another use-case for PASIDs, you
should keep that in mind. The mdev abstraction was made for a different
use-case.

To be clear, I agree that the aux-domain specifics should be removed
from the IOMMU-API, but the mdev-abstraction itself still makes sense.

For example?
