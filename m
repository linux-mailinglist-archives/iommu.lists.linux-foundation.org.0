OK, as for the ECMDQ patches I think we'll need some investigation with 
real workloads to judge whether we can benefit from these things enough 
to justify the complexity, and whether the design is right.

My gut feeling is that if these multi-queue schemes really can live up 
to their promise of making contention negligible, then they should 
further stand to benefit from bypassing the complex lock-free command 
batching in favour of something more lightweight, which could change the 
direction of much of the refactoring.

Interesting, thanks. So it sounds like this is something you can get 
away with for the moment, but may need to revisit once people chasing 
real-world performance start wanting to turn that bit off.

Indeed between the iommu_iotlb_gather mechanism and low-level command 
batching things are already a lot more concentrated than they could be, 
but arm_smmu_cmdq_batch_add() and its callers stand out as examples of 
where we'd still be vulnerable to preemption. What I haven't even tried 
to reason about yet is assumptions in the higher-level APIs, e.g. if 
io-pgtable might chuck out a TLBI during an iommu_unmap() which we 
implicitly expect a later iommu_iotlb_sync() to cover.

I've been thinking that in many ways per-domain queues make quite a bit 
of sense and would be easier to manage than per-CPU ones - plus that's 
pretty much the usage model once we get to VMs anyway - but that fails 
to help the significant cases like networking and storage where many 
CPUs are servicing a big monolithic device in a single domain :(

Robin.
