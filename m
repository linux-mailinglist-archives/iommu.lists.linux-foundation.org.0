Yeah, these would be purely used for reserving regions in the IOVA so
that they won't be used by the IOVA allocator. Typically these would be
used for cases where those addresses have some special meaning.

Do we want something like:

	compatible =3D "iommu-reserved";

for these? Or would that need to be:

	compatible =3D "linux,iommu-reserved";

? There seems to be a mix of vendor-prefix vs. non-vendor-prefix
compatible strings in the reserved-memory DT bindings directory.

On the other hand, do we actually need the compatible string? Because we
don't really want to associate much extra information with this like we
do for example with "shared-dma-pool". The logic to handle this would
all be within the IOMMU framework. All we really need is for the
standard reservation code to skip nodes that don't have a reg property
so we don't reserve memory for "virtual-only" allocations.

The only case that would be problematic would be if we have overlapping
physical regions, because that will probably trip up the standard code.

But this could also be worked around by looking at iommu-addresses. For
example, if we had something like this:

	reserved-memory {
		fb_dc0: fb@80000000 {
			reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
			iommu-addresses =3D <0xa0000000 0x01000000>;
		};

		fb_dc1: fb@80000000 {
			reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
			iommu-addresses =3D <0xb0000000 0x01000000>;
		};
	};

We could make the code identify that this is for the same physical
reservation (maybe make it so that reg needs to match exactly for this
to be recognized) but with different virtual allocations.

On a side-note: do we really need to repeat the size? I'd think if we
want mappings then we'd likely want them for the whole reservation.

I'd like to keep references to IOMMUs out of this because they would be
duplicated. We will only use these nodes if they are referenced by a
device node that also has an iommus property. Also, the IOMMU reference
itself isn't enough. We'd also need to support the complete specifier
because you can have things like SIDs in there to specify the exact
address space that a device uses.

Also, for some of these they may be reused independently of the IOMMU
address space. For example the Tegra framebuffer identity mapping can
be used by either of the 2-4 display controllers, each with (at least
potentially) their own address space. But we don't want to have to
describe the identity mapping separately for each display controller.

Another thing to consider is that these nodes will often be added by
firmware (e.g. firmware will allocate the framebuffer and set up the
corresponding reserved memory region in DT). Wiring up references like
this would get very complicated very quickly.

Yeah, my only concern was that we might break users of this that are not
sophisticated enough to handle the nuances that we'd introduce here. If
we can assume that nodes without a reg property will be ignored, then I
think that's good enough.
