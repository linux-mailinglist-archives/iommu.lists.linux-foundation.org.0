How is that hooked up into the Documentation index?

 Documentation/x86/enqcmd.rst: WARNING: document isn't included in any toctree

So the document is about ENQCMD, right? Can you please make that in some
way consistently named?

This lacks any docbook formatting.... The resulting HTML looks like ...

Sorry that's not background information, that's an agglomeration of
words.

Can you please explain properly what's the background of SVA, how it
differs from regular device addressing and what kind of requirements it
has?

ENQCMD is not related to background. It's part of the new technology.

Sigh. The important part here is not the MSR. The important part is to
explain what PASID is and where it comes from. Documentation has similar
rules as changelogs:

      1) Provide context

      2) Explain requirements
      
      3) Explain implementation

The pile you provided is completely backwards and unstructured.

Thanks,

        tglx
