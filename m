Hm, how fine a capability are we talking about?  If it's just "give me
VT-d capabilities" or "give me Arm capabilities" that would work, but
probably isn't useful. Anything finer will be awkward because userspace
will have to try combinations of capabilities to see what sticks, and
supporting new hardware will drop compatibility for older one.

For example depending whether the hardware IOMMU is SMMUv2 or SMMUv3, that
completely changes the capabilities offered to the guest (some v2
implementations support nesting page tables, but never PASID nor PRI
unlike v3.) The same vIOMMU could support either, presenting different
capabilities to the guest, even multiple page table formats if we wanted
to be exhaustive (SMMUv2 supports the older 32-bit descriptor), but it
needs to know early on what the hardware is precisely. Then some new page
table format shows up and, although the vIOMMU can support that in
addition to older ones, QEMU will have to pick a single one, that it
assumes the guest knows how to drive?

I think once it binds a device to an IOASID fd, QEMU will want to probe
what hardware features are available before going further with the vIOMMU
setup (is there PASID, PRI, which page table formats are supported,
address size, page granule, etc). Obtaining precise information about the
hardware would be less awkward than trying different configurations until
one succeeds. Binding an additional device would then fail if its pIOMMU
doesn't support exactly the features supported for the first device,
because we don't know which ones the guest will choose. QEMU will have to
open a new IOASID fd for that device.

Thanks,
Jean
