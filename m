Ultimately the spec doesn't mention what IOMMU properties the regions
should have.  Even marking them as IOMMU_READ/WRITE is as much
of an assumption as using IOMMU_MMIO or IOMMU_CACHE. It just seems
IOMMU_MMIO is the most popular since all the examples use it for MSI
doorbells in the documentation.

I am interested why this concern is only being brought up at this point
in a patchset that has been on the mailing list for 8+ months?  This is
based on a spec that has existed from Arm since 2020 with the most recent
revisions published in Feb 2021.  The lack of RMR support in the kernel
is affecting real world products, and the ability for SystemReady ES
certified systems from just fully working with recent distributions.  Even
worse, is that without this patchset customers are forced to jump through
hoops to purposefully re-enable smmu bypass making their systems less
secure.

How is this a good experience for customers of SystemReady hardware
when for any mainline distribution to work the first thing they have to do is
make their system less secure?
