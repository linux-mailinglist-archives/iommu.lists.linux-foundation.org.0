This is broadly similar to the approach used by rockchip-iommu and the 
special arm-smmu-nvidia implementation, where there are multiple 
instances which require programming identically, that are abstracted 
behind a single "device". Your case is a little different since you're 
not programming both *entirely* identically, although maybe that's a 
possibility if each respective ID isn't used by anything else on the 
"other" DART?

Overall I tend to view this approach as a bit of a hack because it's not 
really describing the hardware truthfully - just because two distinct 
functional blocks have their IRQ lines wired together doesn't suddenly 
make them a single monolithic block with multiple interfaces - and tends 
to be done for the sake of making the driver implementation easier in 
terms of the Linux IOMMU API (which, note, hasn't evolved all that far 
from its PCI-centric origins and isn't exactly great for arbitrary SoC 
topologies).

This approach is arguably the most honest, and more robust in terms of 
making fewer assumptions, and is used by at least exynos-iommu and 
omap-iommu. In Linux it currently takes a little bit more housekeeping 
to keep track of linked instances within the driver since the IOMMU API 
holds the notion that any given client device is associated with "an 
IOMMU", but that's always free to change at any time, unlike the design 
of a DT binding.

There's also the funky "root" and "leaf" devices thing that ipmmu-vmsa 
does, although I believe that represents genuine hardware differences 
where the leaves are more like extra TLBs rather than fully-functional 
IOMMU blocks in their own right, so that may not be a relevant model here.
