Oh, -1 for my reading comprehension but +1 for my confidence in the 
patch then :)

I'll let Will have the final say over how cautious we really want to be 
here, but as far as I'm concerned it's a welcome cleanup as-is. Ditto 
for patch #32 based on the same reasoning, although I don't have a 
suitable test platform on-hand to sanity-check that one.

Cheers,
Robin.
