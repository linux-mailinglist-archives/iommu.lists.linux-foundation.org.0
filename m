Hello Robin.

Sorry for the delayed answer. My comments are below.

Well, I'd say it wasn't documented or even discussed at all. At least
after a pretty much comprehensive retrospective research I failed to
find any note about the reason of having all the dma_direct_map*()
methods converted to supporting the dma_pfn_offset/dma_range_map
ranges, but leaving the dma_direct_map_resource() method out of that
conversion. Neither it is immediately inferable from the method usage
and its prototype that it is supposed to be utilized for the DMA
memory addresses, not the CPU one.

Hmm, what if the driver was previously using for instance the
dma_direct_map_sg() method for it? Following this logic you would have
needed to decline the whole dma_pfn_offset/dma_range_map ranges
support, since the dma_direct_map_sg(), dma_direct_map_page(),
dma_direct_alloc*() methods do take the offsets into account. What we
can see now is that the same physical address will be differently
mapped by the dma_map_resource() and, for instance, dma_map_sg()
methods. All of these methods expect to have the "phys_addr_t" address
passed, which is the CPU address, not the DMA one. Doesn't that look
erroneous? IIUC in accordance with the common kernel definition the
"resource" suffix indicates the CPU-visible address (like struct
resource range), not the DMA address. No matter whether it's used to
describe the RAM or MMIO range.

AFAICS the dma_range_map just defines the offset-based DMA-to-CPU
mapping for the particular bus/device. If the device driver already
knows the DMA address why does it need to map it at all? I see some
contradiction here.

I don't have such. But what I see here is either the wrong
dma_direct_map_resource() implementation or a redundant mapping
performed in some platforms/DMA-device drivers. Indeed judging by the
dma_map_resource() method declaration it expects to have the
CPU-address passed, which will be mapped in accordance with the
"dma-ranges"-based DMA-to-CPU memory mapping in the same way as the
rest of the dma_direct-family methods. If DMA address is already known
then it is supposed to be used as-is with no any additional remapping
procedure performed.

The last but not least regarding the DMA controllers and the
dma_map_resource() usage. The dma_slave_config structure was converted
to having the CPU-physical src/dst address specified in commit
9575632052ba ("dmaengine: make slave address physical"). So the DMA
client drivers now have to set the slave source and destination
addresses defined in the CPU address space, while the DMA engine
driver needs to map it in accordance with the platform/device specific
configs.

To sum up as I see it the problem is in the dma_map_resource()
semantics still exist. The semantic isn't documented in any way while
its implementation looks confusing. You say that the method
expects to have the DMA address passed, but at the same
time it has the phys_addr argument of the phys_addr_t type. If it had
dma_addr_t type instead that would have been much less confusing.
Could you clarify whether my considerations above are wrong and in what
aspect?
