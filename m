OK, I think I can imagine what's happening there - I could elaborate if 
you're particularly interested, but suffice to say that despite all the 
tricks we've put in to avoid spending unnecessary time down that path 
wherever possible, there are still ways the allocator could behave 
pathologically once the low end below 32 bits gets (nearly) full. As far 
as that command-line option goes, I just happened to notice that it 
already existed and has the same effect as the hack I was going to 
suggest ;)

Either way, though, I'm inclined to agree that it might be time to stop 
applying that particular "optimisation" indiscriminately - I'll cook up 
some patches.

Ah, OK, I guess I assumed the TX path might copy into preallocated DMA 
buffers such that it would use a pool too. Fair enough if it doesn't.
(Although perhaps it's still worth noting that IOMMUs are liable to skew 
the threshold for zero-copy benefits in general)
