Ok, maybe I'll hold off a bit and work on other things, to avoid feet stomping..

I don't suppose you have thoughts about split pagetables, which is one
of the things we want for implementing per-context pagetables?  I
suppose that is less of an impl thing and more an architecture thing,
but maybe no one on other implementations wants this?
