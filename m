Nope, just a theoretical best-effort thing, which I'm certainly not 
going to lose sleep over either way - I just felt compelled to question 
the rationale which didn't seem to fit. Realistically, this 
partial-unmap case is not well-defined in IOMMU API terms, and other 
drivers don't handle it consistently. I think VFIO explicitly rejects 
partial unmaps, so if we see them at all it's only likely to be from 
GPU/SVA type users who in principle ought to be able to tolerate 
transient faults from BBM anyway.

Robin.
