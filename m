Couldn't this make things weirdly order dependent though?  If device A
has strictly more capabilities than device B, then attaching A then B
will be fine, but B then A will trigger a new ioasid fd.

Hm, ok.  I really haven't understood how the PASIDs fit into this
then.  I'll try again on v2.

Ok, stepping back, what exactly do you mean by "processes" above?  Do
you mean Linux processes, or something else?
