I like the bitfield idea; it would certainly emphasise the "you have to 
do something more with this" angle that I'm pushing towards here, but 
still leave things framed in TCR terms without having to go to some more 
general abstraction. It really doesn't play into your EPD argument 
though - such a config would be providing TxSZ/TGx/IRGNx/ORGNx/SHx, but 
EPDy, for y = !x. For a driver to understand that and do the right thing 
with it is even more involved than for the driver to just set EPD1 by 
itself anyway.

(FWIW I'm not sure that that is a reasonable expectation, at least for 
anyone savvy enough to be programming an MMU in the first place. There 
are plenty of systems with RAM at 0x0)

The downside is maintaining extra complexity for the sake of a 
theoretical concern which hasn't been borne out in practice, with a 
promise of yet more complexity down the line. Moving the 3 babies which 
anyone acknowledges into their own private baths takes a whole -8 lines 
of code to implement. That said, if we don't go down the bitfield route, 
then I *can* leave the default TCR having EPD1 set if that makes you 
feel warm and safe, but it will still be resoundingly ignored.

If only LPAE had created these bits as enables rather than disables then 
things would be logical and we could all be happy, but here we are...

Robin.
