Yes.

Fair enough.

I mean a single iommu_domain should be used by all devices sharing a
single iommu_group.

Yes.

I am thinking whether it's feasible to change "bind/attach a device to
an IOASID" to "bind/attach an isolated unit to an IOASID". An isolated
unit could be

1) an iommu_ group including single or multiple devices;
2) a physical device which have a 1-device iommu group + device ID
    (PASID/subStreamID) which represents an isolated subdevice inside the
    physical one.
3) anything that we might have in the future.

A handler which represents the connection between device and iommu is
returned on any successful binding. This handler could be used to
GET_INFO and attach/detach after binding.

Best regards,
baolu
