I did start digging into the data (thanks for that!) before Christmas, 
but between being generally frazzled and trying to remember how to write 
Perl to massage the numbers out of the log dump I never got round to 
responding, sorry.

The partial thoughts that I can recall right now are firstly that the 
total numbers of IOVAs are actually pretty meaningless, it really needs 
to be broken down by size (that's where my Perl-hacking stalled...); 
secondly that the pattern is far more than just a steady increase - the 
CPU rcache count looks to be heading asymptotically towards ~65K IOVAs 
all the time, representing (IIRC) two sizes being in heavy rotation, 
while the depot is happily ticking along in a steady state as expected, 
until it suddenly explodes out of nowhere; thirdly, I'd really like to 
see instrumentation of the flush queues at the same time, since I think 
they're the real culprit.

My theory so far is that everyone is calling queue_iova() frequently 
enough to keep the timer at bay and their own queues drained. Then at 
the ~16H mark, *something* happens that pauses unmaps long enough for 
the timer to fire, and at that point all hell breaks loose. The depot is 
suddenly flooded with IOVAs of *all* sizes, indicative of all the queues 
being flushed at once (note that the two most common sizes have been 
hovering perilously close to "full" the whole time), but then, 
crucially, *that keeps happening*. My guess is that the load of 
fq_flush_timeout() slows things down enough that the the timer then 
keeps getting the chance to expire and repeat the situation.

The main conclusion I draw from this is the same one that was my initial 
gut feeling; that MAX_GLOBAL_MAGS = 32 is utter bollocks. The CPU rcache 
capacity scales with the number of CPUs; the flush queue capacity scales 
with the number of CPUs; it is nonsensical that the depot size does not 
correspondingly scale with the number of CPUs (I note that the testing 
on the original patchset cites a 16-CPU system, where that depot 
capacity is conveniently equal to the total rcache capacity).

Now yes, purging the rcaches when the depot is full does indeed help 
mitigate this scenario - I assume it provides enough of a buffer where 
the regular free_iova_fast() calls don't hit queue_iova() for a while 
(and gives fq_ring_free() some reprieve on the CPU handling the 
timeout), giving enough leeway for the flood to finish before anyone 
starts hitting queues/locks/etc. and stalling again, and thus break the 
self-perpetuating timeout cycle. But that's still only a damage 
limitation exercise! It's planning for failure to just lie down and 
assume that the depot is going to be full if fq_flush_timeout() ever 
fires because it's something like an order of magnitude smaller than the 
flush queue capacity (even for a uniform distribution of IOVA sizes) on 
super-large systems.

I'm honestly tempted to move my position further towards a hard NAK on 
this approach, because all the evidence so far points to it being a 
bodge around a clear and easily-fixed scalability oversight. At the very 
least I'd now want to hear a reasoned justification for why you want to 
keep the depot at an arbitrary fixed size while the whole rest of the 
system scales (I'm assuming that since my previous suggestion to try 
changes in that area seems to have been ignored).

Cheers,
Robin.
