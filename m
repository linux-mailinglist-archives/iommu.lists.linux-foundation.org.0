Thanks, you're right, the "ULL" suffix is not needed, and could cause
future issues.

Definitely.

"-1" definitely causes warnings, depending on your compiler (not with
the gcc 9.3.0 I'm currently using, though).

Obviously I was misled by the old code, and instead of changing
the cast, I replaced the cast ("casts are evil") by a suffix. Doh.

Any, I've just sent a patch. Thanks!
