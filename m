I did wonder about explicitly clamping lvl to ensure that it couldn't 
possibly recurse any further than the multi-function version, but given 
that you'd need to craft a suitable bogus pagetable in addition to 
corrupting the arguments to be able to exploit it at all, that seemed 
perhaps a little too paranoid. Happy to add something like:

	if (WARN_ON(lvl > PAGE_MODE_7_LEVEL))
		return NULL;

if you like, though.

Heh, it's merely a direct transformation of the logic encoded in the 
existing "DEFINE_FREE_PT_FN(...)" cases - I assume that's just an 
optimisation, so I'll add a comment to that effect.

Thanks,
Robin.
