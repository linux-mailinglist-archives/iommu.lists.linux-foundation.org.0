Damnit, I fell for that didn't I?

Overall, I'm really nervous about the concurrency here and think we'd be
better off requiring the unbind as we have for the other domain changes.

With your changes, I think quite a few things can go wrong.

  * cookie->fq_domain may be observed but iovad->fq could be NULL
  * We can miss the smp_wmb() in the pgtable code but end up deferring the
    IOVA reclaim
  * iommu_change_dev_def_domain() only holds the group mutex afaict, so can
    possibly run concurrently with itself on the same domain?
  * iommu_dma_init_fq() can flip the domain type back from
    IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA_FQ to IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA on the error path
  * set_pgtable_quirks() isn't atomic, which probably is ok for now, but the
    moment we use it anywhere else it's dangerous

and I suspect there are more :/
