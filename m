Definitely agree with this, and I hope none will implement stop marker.
For devices that *don't* use a stop marker, the PCIe spec says (10.4.1.2):

  To stop [using a PASID] without using a Stop Marker Message, the
  function shall:
  1. Stop queueing new Page Request Messages for this PASID.
  2. Finish transmitting any multi-page Page Request Messages for this
     PASID (i.e. send the Page Request Message with the L bit Set).
  3. Wait for PRG Response Messages associated any outstanding Page
     Request Messages for the PASID.

So they have to flush their PR themselves. And since the device driver
completes this sequence before calling unbind(), then there shouldn't be
any oustanding PR for the PASID, and unbind() doesn't need to flush,
right?

But in the sequence above, step 1 should ensure that the device will not
send another PR for any successful response coming back at step 3.

So I agree with the below if we suspect there could be pending PR, but
given that pending PR are a stop marker thing and we don't know any device
using stop markers, I wondered why I bothered implementing PRIq flush at
all for SMMUv3, hence this RFC.

Thanks,
Jean
