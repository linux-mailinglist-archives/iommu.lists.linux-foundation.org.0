A follow-up to my earlier post ....

Hearing no objection, I've submitted the VIOT table description to
the ASWG for consideration under what they call the "code first"
process.  The "first reading" -- a brief discussion on what the
table is and why we would like to add it -- was held yesterday.
No concerns have been raised as yet.  Given the discussions that
have already occurred, I don't expect any, either.  I have been
wrong at least once before, however.

At this point, ASWG will revisit the request to add VIOT each
week.  If there have been no comments in the prior week, and no
further discussion during the meeting, then a vote will be taken.
Otherwise, there will be discussion and we try again the next
week.

The ASWG was also told that the likelihood of this definition of
the table changing is pretty low, and that it has been thought out
pretty well already.  ASWG's consideration will therefore start
from the assumption that it would be best _not_ to make changes.

So, I'll let you know what happens next week.
