The allocations are only 4K in size (packet memory) but there are a lot
of them.  I tried running with "forcedac" over the weekend, and that
seems to have made a huge difference.  Why the name of 'forcedac'?  It
would seem this should be the default for a system with a sane 64-bit PCI
device.

Most of the dma_map() overhead is coming from the TX path, which isn't
using the page_pool.

With the RX datapath I'm using, pages are returned to the pool in a
non-napi context (so they enter the ring), then the driver refills the
cache from the ring.  I'm seeing a 1% overflow (ring_full), so the
default size seems appropriate.  The single ring lock is likely a
problem, but can be addressed now that things aren't blowing up in
alloc_iova().

From a box with the mlx4 driver + persistent page pool:

     rx_alloc_pages: 35239524767
     cache_hit: 34381377143
     cache_full: 19935
     cache_empty: 859266494
     ring_consume: 31665993135
     ring_produce: 31666119491
     ring_full: 353805844
