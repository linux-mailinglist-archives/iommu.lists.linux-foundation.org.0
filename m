Ah, OK, I wasn't aware that the NHI isn't even the right thing in the 
first place :(

Is there an easy way to get from the struct tb to a PCI device 
representing the end of its relevant tunnel, or do we have a circular 
dependency problem where the latter won't appear until we've authorised 
it (and thus the IOMMU layer won't know about it yet either)?

Thanks,
Robin.
