What features would those be?  There are no mdev specific parts of the
vfio uAPI.

The mdev device is a virtual device, by why it it virtual in this case?
Aren't we effectively assigning the VF itself (mdev device == VF device)
with a bunch of extra support code to fill in the gaps of the VF
implementing the complete device model in hardware?

We're effectively creating this virtual device, creating a fake IOMMU
group, and trying to create this association of this virtual device to
the real VF in order to shoehorn it into the mdev model.  What do we
get from that model other than lifecycle management (ie. type selection)
and re-use of a bunch of code from the driver supporting the 1) model
above?

This specific model seems better served by a device specific peer
driver to vfio-pci (ie. a "vfio-pci variant").  You effectively already
have the code for this driver, it's just in the format of an mdev
driver rather than a vfio "bus driver".  The work Jason references
relative to Max aims to make these kinds of drivers easier to implement
through re-use of vfio-pci code.

There are certainly other solutions we could come up with for selecting
a specific device type for a vfio-pci variant driver to implement other
than pretending this model actually belongs in mdev, right?  Thanks,

Alex
