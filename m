Same thing that prevents the bus pointer from suddenly becoming invalid 
in the current code, I guess :)

But yes, holding a group reference alone can't prevent the group itself 
from changing, and the finer points of locking still need working out - 
there's a reason you got a link to a WIP branch in my tree rather than a 
proper patch in your inbox (TBH at the moment that one represents about 
a 5:1 ratio of time spent on the reasoning behind the commit message vs. 
the implementation itself).

VFIO hardly needs to retrieve the iommu_group from a device which it 
derived from the iommu_group it holds in the first place. What matters 
is being able to call *other* device-based IOMMU API interfaces in the 
long term. And once a robust solution for that is in place, it should 
inevitably work for a device-based attach interface too.

Indeed, but it's a challenge that needs tackling, because the bus-based 
interfaces need to go away. So either we figure it out now and let this 
attach interface rework benefit immediately, or I spend three times as 
long solving it on my own and end up deleting 
iommu_group_replace_domain() in about 6 months' time anyway.

Thanks,
Robin.
