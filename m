We did recently introduce a "memory-region-names" property that's used
to add context for cases where multiple memory regions are used. Perhaps
the simplest to address the above would be to describe the region as
active by naming it "active". That has the disadvantage of restricting
the number of active regions to 1, though I suspect that may even be
enough for the vast majority of cases where we need this. This would be
similar to how we use the "dma-mem" string in the "interconnect-names"
property to specify the "DMA parent" of a device node.

Alternatively, we could perhaps support multiple occurrences of "active"
in the "memory-region-names" property. Or we could add a bit of
flexibility by considering all memory regions whose names have an
"active-" prefix as being active.

Yeah, from a quick look at that series, this actually sounds really
close to what I'm trying to achieve here.

The patch set that I have would nicely complement the code added to
iommu_dma_get_resv_regions() for RMR regions. It's not exactly the same
code, but it's basically the DT equivalent of
iort_dev_rmr_get_resv_regions().
