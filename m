The comment notes two assumptions (although the grammar is poor, which I
will fix). Yes, the previous code made the second assumption, the new
code makes both assumptions.

Yes, well unfortunately we have no other way to determine what host
bridges can communicate with P2P. We settled on a whitelist when the
series was first patch. Nobody likes that situation, but nobody has
found anything better. We've been hoping standards bodies would give us
a flag but I haven't heard anything about that. At least AMD has been
able to guarantee us that all CPUs newer than Zen will support so that
covers a large swath. It would be nice if we could say something similar
for Intel.

Because we hold a reference to a child device of the bus. So the host
bus device can't go away until the child device has been released. An
earlier version of the P2PDMA patchset had a lot more extraneous get
device calls until someone else pointed this out.

Per above, I think the reference count is unnecessary. But I could wrap
it in a static function for clarity. (There's no reason to export this
function).

Yeah, it's impossible to make a p2pdma call before the PCIe bus is
initialized. They have to have access to at least one PCI device before
they can even attempt it.
