We have optional and mandatory resources. In this situation a driver has
to decide what to do. Either it continues with limited resources or it
defers probing. Some drivers try to allocate the optional resources at
open time so that they are able to use them once they are available.  We
could even think of an asynchronous callback into a driver when a
resource becomes available. Whether we put this decision what is
optional or not into the driver or in the framework doesn't make a
difference to the problem, it is still the same: When a resource is not
yet available we have no idea if and when it becomes available, if it's
worth waiting for it or not.

The difference is that with my proposal (which isn't actually mine but
from my collegue Lucas) a driver can decide very fine grained how it
wants to deal with the situation. With fw_devlink we try to put this
intelligence into the framework and it seems there are quite some quirks
necessary to get that running for everyone.

Anyway, we have fw_devlink now and actually I think the dependency graph
that we have with fw_devlink is quite nice to resolve the natural probe
order. But why do we have to put an extra penalty on drivers whose
resources are not yet available?  Probe devices with complete resources
as long as you find them, execute more initcalls as long as there are
any, but when there are no more left, you could start probing devices
with incomplete resources, why wait for another ten seconds?

For me it's no problem when the UART probes late, we have earlycon which
can be used to debug problems that arise before the UART probes, but
what nags is the ten seconds delay. zero would be a much saner value for
me.
