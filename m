Yes, BBML is purely about swapping between a block (hugepage) entry and 
a table representing the exact equivalent mapping.

A break-before-make procedure isn't required when just changing 
permissions, and AFAICS it doesn't apply to changing the DBM bit either, 
but as mentioned I think we could probably just not do that anyway.
