That's right. The other two devices only have legacy PCI headers. So 
they can't claim to be RCiEP's but just integrated endpoints. The legacy
devices don't even have a PCIe header.

I honestly don't know why these are groped as MFD's in the first place.

You point is that integrated MFD endpoints, without ACS, there is no 
gaurantee to SW that they are isolated.

As far as a quirk, do you think:
	- a cmdline optput for integrated endpoints, and RCiEP's suffice?
	  along with a compile time default that is strict enforcement
	- typical vid/did type exception list?

A more generic way to ask for exception would be scalable until we can stop
those type of integrated devices. Or we need to maintain these device lists
for eternity. 

Cheers,
Ashok
