Simplifying the maze is most welcome, however one thing stands out...

Is it even possible to hit this case now? From a quick look, all the 
architectures defining HIGHMEM either have an explicit dependency on MMU 
or don't allow deselecting it anyway (plus I don't see how HIGHMEM && 
!MMU could work in general), so I'm pretty sure this whole chunk should 
go away now.

With that (or if there *is* some subtle wacky case where PageHighmem() 
can actually return true for !MMU, a comment to remind us in future),
