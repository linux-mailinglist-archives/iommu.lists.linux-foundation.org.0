The problem with this implementation is that if you fall outside the
max number/size for the bounce buffer pools, then DMA performance can
fall off of a cliff. Although those max parameters are tunable, it's
always possible to construct a workload that falls outside of the
expected bounds. I think this can be addressed by adding a fallback
pooling structure. It won't necessarily be as performant as the
primary buffer pools, but I think it should work reasonably well for
usage patterns that fall outside the primary buffer pools.
