It is based on the state of the BSP when TXT vectors to the measured
launch environment. It is documented in the TXT spec and the SDMs.

Yes that is a very good point. In other places when measuring we make
sure to skip things like addresses and sizes of things outside of the
structure being measured. This needs to be done with boot params too.

Yea this was there to prevent that blind loading of __BOOT_DS. I see it
is gone so I will remove the comment and the place where the flag is set.

Could you elaborate on this some more? I am not sure I see places in the
secure launch asm that would be creating relocations like this.

Thank you,
