Let's see a non-SVA case. We are not using SVA, we can have
a memory pool by hugetlb or pin, and app can allocate memory
from this pool, and get stable I/O performance on the memory
from the pool. But device has its separate page table which
is not bound with this process, thus lacking the protection
of process space isolation. Plus, CPU and device are using
different address.

And then we move to SVA case, we can still have a memory pool
by hugetlb or pin, and app can allocate memory from this pool
since this pool is mapped to the address space of the process,
and we are able to get stable I/O performance since it is always
there. But in this case, device is using the page table of
process with the full permission control.
And they are using same address and can possibly enjoy the easy
programming if HW supports.

SVA is not doom to work with IO page fault only. If we have SVA+pin,
we would get both sharing address and stable I/O latency.
