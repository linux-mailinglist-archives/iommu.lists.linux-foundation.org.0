Great. Thanks for clarifying.

I don't think this flag would work for guest userspace drivers. Should I
add a note about that in the flag definition?

Sorry, I was mistaken. We do support VFIO in guests but not for virtio
devices, only for regular PCI devices. In which case they will use
address translation.

Ok, so the guest kernel has to forbid VFIO access on devices where this
flag is advertised.

The fact that VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_NO_TRANSLATION is set
communicates that knowledge to virtio. There is a shared understanding
between the guest and the host about what this flag being set means.
