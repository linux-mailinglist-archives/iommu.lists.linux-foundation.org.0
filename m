Agreed about using io-pgtable helpers directly.. the gpu's use-case is
pretty far different from anything normal/sane, and I don't think it
is worth designing some generic iommu interfaces with precisely one
user[*].  We just need enough in arm-smmu(/-impl) to bootstrap things
when we power up the gpu.

BR,
-R

[*] all the other gpu's that I've seen so far, even if they sit behind
an iommu, they have their own internal mmu
