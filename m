Right, I think we can simplify the interface by modelling the
preregistration as a nesting layer.  Well, mostly.. the wrinkle is
that generally you can't do anything with an ioasid until you've
attached devices to it, but that doesn't really make sense for the
prereg layer.  I expect we can find some way to deal with that,
though.

Actually... to simplify that "weak nesting" concept I wonder if we
want to expand to 3 ways of specifying the pagetables for the ioasid:
  1) kernel managed (MAP/UNMAP)
  2) user managed (BIND/INVALIDATE)
  3) pass-though (IOVA=3D=3Dparent address)

Obviously pass-through wouldn't be allowed in all circumstances.

I don't think it reasonably can.  Until attached, you don't actually
know what hardware IOMMU will be backing it, and therefore you don't
know it's capabilities.  You can't really allow mappings if you don't
even know allowed IOVA ranges and page size.

Yes... but as above, we have no idea what the IOMMU's capabilities are
until devices are attached.

The group number could be used for that, even if there are no group
fds.  You generally can't identify things more narrowly than group
anyway.
