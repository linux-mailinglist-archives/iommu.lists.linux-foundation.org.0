As Rob mentioned, device link should take care of all the dependencies 
between
SMMU and its consumers. But not sure how the question relates to this 
patch as this
change is for system pm and not runtime pm, so it is exactly the 
sequence of
SMMU probe/remove which if works currently for that GPU SMMU, then it 
should work
just fine for system suspend and resume as well.

If we are unable to turn on the clks then its fatal and we will not live 
for long.
