This should work for us.
My only concern is that many of our users would be using DMA-Buf memory, 
so DMA mapping would be done using dma_buf_map_attachment which I believe 
still doesn't support specifying any DMA attributes. 

I had previously tried to get support added upstream but wasn't 
successful.
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/18/826
https://lkml.org/lkml/2019/1/18/827

But perhaps this new attribute will provide enough justification for DMA 
attributes (in some form, either explicitly or via flags) to be supported 
via dma_buf_map_attachment.
