Hi Jason,

I thought we discussed this at LPC, but still seems to be going in
circles :-(.

As you had suggested earlier in the mail thread could Jason Wang maybe
build out what it takes to have a full fledged /dev/sva interface for vDPA
and figure out how the interfaces should emerge? otherwise it appears
everyone is talking very high level and with that limited understanding of
how things work at the moment. 

As Kevin pointed out there are several aspects, and a real prototype from
interested people would be the best way to understand the easy/hard aspects
of moving between the proposals.

- PASID allocation and life cycle management
  Managing both 1-1 (as its done today) and also support a guest PASID
  space. (Supporting guest PASID range is required for migration I suppose)
- Page request processing.
- Interaction with vIOMMU, vSVA requires vIOMMU for supporting
  invalidations, forwarding prq and such.
- Supporting ENQCMD in guest. (Today its just in Intel products, but its
  also submitted to PCIe SIG) and if you are a member should be able to see
  that. FWIW, it might already be open for public review, it not now maybe
  pretty soon.
  
  For Intel we have some KVM interaction setting up the guest pasid->host
  pasid interaces.

This has to move ahead of these email discussions, hoping somone with the
right ideas would help move this forward.

Cheers,
Ashok
