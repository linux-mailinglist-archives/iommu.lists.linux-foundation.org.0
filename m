Ah, right you are, I keep forgetting that.

And actually that one's on me as well - for some reason I was thinking 
that this had never worked, and therefore you could likely get a Hyper-V 
update pushed out long before users get this patch through distros, but 
of course it only becomes an issue now because previously there was no 
connection to any ACPI node at all. As I said, personally I'm happy to 
consider this a Hyper-V internal workaround, but if anyone else objects 
to poking at the ACPI flags, I suppose you've also got the fallback 
option of flipping it around and making the ACPI_COMPANION_SET() 
conditional, so that the behaviour for older versions remains entirely 
unchanged. If it happens, feel free to keep my ack for that approach too.

Cheers,
Robin.
