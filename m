I may not get you.

Assume that dirty_page_trackable is an attribution of an iommu_domain.
This attribution might be changed once a new device (with different
capability) added or removed. So it should be updated every time a new
device is attached or detached. This work could be done by the vendor
iommu driver on the path of dev_attach/dev_detach callback.

For upper layers, before starting page tracking, they check the
dirty_page_trackable attribution of the domain and start it only it's
capable. Once the page tracking is switched on the vendor iommu driver
(or iommu core) should block further device attach/detach operations
until page tracking is stopped.

The maintainer owns the last word, but we need to work out a generic and
self-contained API set.

Best regards,
baolu
