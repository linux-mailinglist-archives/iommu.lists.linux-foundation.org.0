That case is where a single device, due to combinations of PCI DMA 
aliasing conditions, has multiple IDs of its own, and two or more of 
those IDs also happen to end up the same as each other. What you have is 
two distinct devices both claiming the same ID, since apparently they 
both represent the same underlying physical device (I don't know how the 
endpoint and pcieport drivers interoperate and/or coexist, but I can 
easily imagine that some liberties may be taken that the IOMMU layer 
doesn't really anticipate).

I'd imagine it's most likely that the PCI grouping rules are just 
putting everything together due to a lack of ACS. Either way, I'm pretty 
sure the PCI logic *doesn't* consider actual PCI devices having 
overlapping Requester IDs, because that isn't a real thing (how would 
config accesses work?). You can consider yourself lucky that the devices 
do happen to be grouped already in your particular case, but that 
doesn't change the fact that there's basically no point in trying to 
handle Stream ID aliasing within groups without properly implementing 
the grouping-by-Stream-ID logic in the first place (note that even 
distinct ACS-isolated PCI endpoints could still alias beyond the host 
bridge at the SMMU input if the system's translation from Requester ID 
space to Stream ID space isn't 1:1)

We handle it in the SMMUv2 driver - the way that architecture does 
stream mapping makes it really easy to hang group pointers off the S2CRs 
and have arm_smmu_master_alloc_smes() and arm_smmu_device_group() work 
nicely together. Unfortunately it's not feasible to take the same 
approach for SMMUv3, since the Stream Table there may be up to 2^32 
entries (vs. up to 128 S2CRs), and there just isn't enough room to 
encode a group pointer directly in an STE itself (you don't want to 
imagine how much time I've spent trying to think up schemes for that...)

Robin.
