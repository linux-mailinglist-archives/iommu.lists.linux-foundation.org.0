That's what I said.

Are you actually reading what I write and caring to look at the code?

PCI-MSI does not have a compose message callback in the irq chip. The
message is composed by the underlying parent domain. Same for HPET.

The only dogdy part is the IO/APIC for hysterical raisins and because
I did not come around yet to sort that out.

Right. So we really want to stick the restriction into a compat-MSI
domain to make stuff match reality and to avoid banging the head against
the wall sooner than later.

Thanks,
