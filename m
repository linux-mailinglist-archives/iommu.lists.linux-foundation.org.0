We'd need a part of DMA API that promises this though. Platform
maintainers aren't going to go out of their way to do the
right thing just for virtio, and I can't track all arches
to make sure they don't violate virtio requirements.

If VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is set then things just work.  If
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM is clear device is supposed to have access to
all of memory.  You can argue in various ways but it's easier to just
declare a behaviour that violates this a bug. Which might still be worth
working around, for various reasons.

One way would be to extend the DMA API with such an API.

Another would be to make virtio always use DMA API
and hide the logic in there.
This second approach is not easy, in particular since DMA API adds
a bunch of overhead which we need to find ways to
measure and mitigate.
