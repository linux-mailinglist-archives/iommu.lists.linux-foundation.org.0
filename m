IIUC, arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() is only for the crashkernel image,
not the whole reserved memory that the crashkernel will use. For the
latter, we avoid the linear map by marking it as nomap in map_mem().

So it looks like reserve_crashkernel() wants to reserve memory before
setting up the linear map with the information about the DMA zones in
place but that comes later when we can parse the firmware tables.

I wonder, instead of not mapping the crashkernel reservation, can we not
do an arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() for the whole reservation after we
created the linear map?

Indeed. So we have 3 options (so far):

1. Allow the crashkernel reservation to go into the linear map but set
   it to invalid once allocated.

2. Parse the flattened DT (not sure what we do with ACPI) before
   creating the linear map. We may have to rely on some SoC ID here
   instead of actual DMA ranges.

3. Assume the smallest ZONE_DMA possible on arm64 (1GB) for crashkernel
   reservations and not rely on arm64_dma_phys_limit in
   reserve_crashkernel().

I think (2) we tried hard to avoid. Option (3) brings us back to the
issues we had on large crashkernel reservations regressing on some
platforms (though it's been a while since, they mostly went quiet ;)).
However, with Chen's crashkernel patches we end up with two
reservations, one in the low DMA zone and one higher, potentially above
4GB. Having a fixed 1GB limit wouldn't be any worse for crashkernel
reservations than what we have now.

If (1) works, I'd go for it (James knows this part better than me),
otherwise we can go for (3).
