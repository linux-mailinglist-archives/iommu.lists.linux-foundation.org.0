In theory this sounds great, but there are still too many assumptions
and too much hand waving about where isolation occurs for me to feel
like I really have the complete picture.  So let's walk through some
examples.  Please fill in and correct where I'm wrong.

1) A dual-function PCIe e1000e NIC where the functions are grouped
   together due to ACS isolation issues.

   a) Initial state: functions 0 & 1 are both bound to e1000e driver.

   b) Admin uses driverctl to bind function 1 to vfio-pci, creating
      vfio device file, which is chmod'd to grant to a user.

   c) User opens vfio function 1 device file and an iommu_fd, binds
   device_fd to iommu_fd.

   Does this succeed?
     - if no, specifically where does it fail?
     - if yes, vfio can now allow access to the device?

   d) Repeat b) for function 0.

   e) Repeat c), still using function 1, is it different?  Where?  Why?

2) The same NIC as 1)

   a) Initial state: functions 0 & 1 bound to vfio-pci, vfio device
      files granted to user, user has bound both device_fds to the same
      iommu_fd.

   AIUI, even though not bound to an IOASID, vfio can now enable access
   through the device_fds, right?  What specific entity has placed these
   devices into a block DMA state, when, and how?

   b) Both devices are attached to the same IOASID.

   Are we assuming that each device was atomically moved to the new
   IOMMU context by the IOASID code?  What if the IOMMU cannot change
   the domain atomically?

   c) The device_fd for function 1 is detached from the IOASID.

   Are we assuming the reverse of b) performed by the IOASID code?

   d) The device_fd for function 1 is unbound from the iommu_fd.

   Does this succeed?
     - if yes, what is the resulting IOMMU context of the device and
       who owns it?
     - if no, well, that results in numerous tear-down issues.

   e) Function 1 is unbound from vfio-pci.

   Does this work or is it blocked?  If blocked, by what entity
   specifically?

   f) Function 1 is bound to e1000e driver.

   We clearly have a violation here, specifically where and by who in
   this path should have prevented us from getting here or who pushes
   the BUG_ON to abort this?

3) A dual-function conventional PCI e1000 NIC where the functions are
   grouped together due to shared RID.

   a) Repeat 2.a) and 2.b) such that we have a valid, user accessible
      devices in the same IOMMU context.

   b) Function 1 is detached from the IOASID.

   I think function 1 cannot be placed into a different IOMMU context
   here, does the detach work?  What's the IOMMU context now?

   c) A new IOASID is alloc'd within the existing iommu_fd and function
      1 is attached to the new IOASID.

   Where, how, by whom does this fail?

If vfio gets to offload all of it's group management to IOASID code,
that's great, but I'm afraid that IOASID is so focused on a
device-level API that we're instead just ignoring the group dynamics
and vfio will be forced to provide oversight to maintain secure
userspace access.  Thanks,

Alex
