I see. Thanks for the clarification. Right, IOMMU is the only reason
to have the current dma_map_resource() implementation.

As I already said our SoC has the next structure (obviously the
diagram is very simplified, but the gist is the same):
              +-----+
              | DDR |
              +--+--+
                 |
  +-----+ +------+-------+ +---------+
  | CPU +-+ Interconnect +-+ DEVs... |
  +-----+ +-----^-+------+ +---------+
     dma-ranges-| |-ranges
              +-+-v-+
              | PCI |
              +-----+
The PCIe peripheral devices are connected to the rest of the system
via the DW PCIe Host controller. If the controller has the inbound
iATU configured to re-map the system memory (RAM, IOMEM) in a
non-one-to-one way (using the dma-ranges DT property of the PCIe host
controller), then all the PCIe bus MRd/MWr TLP addresses will be
accordingly translated on a way to all the connected to the
interconnect slave devices including the MMIO devices. The kernel DMA
API at this moment provides the only methods to get the PCIe-bus
visible RAM addresses, while the physical addresses (for instance of
the MMIO devices) can't be correctly translated for such case. I
thought that dma_map_resource() could do the trick, but it turned out
it didn't get the dma-ranges mapping into account.

To be fully honest currently we don't really have any platform which
would have had the strong requirement of doing DMA from the PCIe
peripheral devices to the platform devices. But since the PCIe bus is
the extendable bus (cold and hot pluggable) then such requirement may
arise in the practice for instance on a platform with the PCIe NTB
device attached to the PCIe bus and configured to access the system
MMIO devices via the bridge. That part I find potentially problematic
seeing the practical usecase is unsupported just due to the incomplete
API. Moreover the dma_direct_map_resource() method semantic being
different from the rest of the direct DMA mapping methods doesn't seem
right from the usability point of view. Finally as you can see having
the dma_direct_map_resource() defined as MMIO-specific doesn't
mean that the dma_pfn_offset-based mapping isn't supposed to be taken
into account.
