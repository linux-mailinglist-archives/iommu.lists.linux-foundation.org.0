Rob mentioned something about the "bus returning zeroes" before, but I agree
that we need more information so that we can reason about this and maintain
the code as the driver continues to change. That needs to be a comment in
the driver, and I don't think "but android seems to work" is a good enough
justification. There was some interaction with HUPCF as well.

As a template, I'd suggest:

Hmm, the more I think about this, the more I think this is an erratum
workaround in disguise, in which case this could be better named...
