Well, there certainly seems no obvious reason for one to WARN where the 
other fails quietly. Either it's an egregious loss of internal 
consistency to not know whether your thing is already attached or it 
isn't, but I don't see why the exact flavour of attach API called should 
matter.

Oh no, I rather like the "core domain" nomenclature, it's the 
"iommu_group_is_..." part that then fails to parse sensibly.

So if it *is* a domain then I can call NULL->attach_dev() and...? ;)

It's true that it's not a non-core domain, but IMO the two negatives 
don't simply cancel out. Hence why I think it's easier to try framing it 
in terms of what the *result* implies, rather than wrestle with trying 
to concisely capture that the check itself is approximately
iommu_group_is_not_already_attached_to_user_allocated_domain().

No, in the context of the iommu_attach_{device,group}() APIs where this 
helper is relevant, after a successful attach, it has long been required 
to detach before another attach can be performed. That's literally the 
code you're moving around in this patch.

(Prior to default domains that wasn't actually enforced, but I doubt all 
the drivers would have handled it correctly.)

This is precisely why I'm starting to think it would be beneficial to 
differentiate the internal interface now that it's firmly moving away 
from the attach/detach paradigm still exposed externally.

FWIW I think the declarations we do have there are all things that got 
refactored out of existing code. I don't see any having been added with 
entirely new functions where easily avoidable.

Heh, if we can ever get to the point where we don't have differing old 
and new semantics side-by-side at almost every level, maybe then we can 
find the right name for *everything*. Besides, it's arguably even 
weirder for attach_domain to be the only way to call detach_dev, so 
there's that.

I certainly don't mind internal/external either, but as I say I'm also 
equally happy with core/user, noting that the latter win on typing 
effort too (and I'll continue to argue that there's not much appreciable 
difference between kernel users and userspace users, since half the time 
it's just going to be semantics of whether userspace has control of 
mappings via IOMMUFD vs. some private driver interface).

Thanks,
Robin.
