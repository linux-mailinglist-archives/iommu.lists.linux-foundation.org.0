Yes.

You are right. I could rephrase it as:

"From the perspective of who is controlling the device to do DMA ..."

Yes, the attributes are of the iommu_group. We have both per-device and
per-iommu_group interfaces. The former is for device drivers and the
latter is only for vfio who has an iommu_group based iommu abstract.

Yes. Sorry for the typo.
