Yup, most recently here:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/cover.1627468308.git.robin.murphy@arm.com/

I'm currently getting v3 ready, so I'll try to remember to add you to 
the CC list.

Well, in my view the "external facing" firmware property *should* 
effectively be the "I don't trust this device not to misbehave" 
property, but I guess it's a bit too conflated with other aspects of 
Thunderbolt root ports (at least in the ACPI definition) to abuse in 
that manner.

Ideas off the top of my head would be to flip the default domain type 
and manually relax all the other performance-sensitive devices instead, 
or module_blacklist the modem driver to load manually later after 
tweaking its group. However, if you think it's a sufficiently general 
concern, maybe a quirk to set pci_dev->untrusted might be worth 
exploring? It may make sense to drive such a thing from a command-line 
option rather than a hard-coded list, though, since trust is really down 
to the individual use-case.

[ re gitlab.arm.com, I understand it tends not to like large transfers - 
some colleagues have reported similar issues pushing large repos as 
well. I'd suggest cloning the base mainline repo from kernel.org or 
another reliable source, then fetching my branch into that. I've just 
tried that on a different machine (outside the work network) and it 
worked fine) ]

Thanks,
Robin.
