The feeling I'm getting from all this is that if we've got as far as 
iommu_dma_protection_show() then it's really too late to meaningfully 
mitigate bad firmware. We should be able to detect missing 
untrusted/external-facing properties as early as nhi_probe(), and if we 
could go into "continue at your own risk" mode right then *before* 
anything else happens, it all becomes a lot easier to reason about. If 
there's a strong enough impetus from Microsoft for system vendors to get 
their firmware right, hopefully we can get away with not trying too hard 
to cope with systems that haven't.

I'm inclined to send v2 of this patch effectively going back to my 
original (even simpler) cleanup, just now with much more reasoning about 
why it isn't doing more :)

Cheers,
Robin.
