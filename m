FWIW, given that the underlying invalidation mechanism is range-based, 
this driver would be an ideal candidate for making use of the new 
iommu_gather mechanism. As a fix for stable, though, simply ensuring 
that add_flush syncs any pending invalidation before issuing a new one 
sounds like a good idea (and probably a simpler patch too).

Commit 07fdef34d2be ("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Implement flush_iotlb_all 
hook") has an explanation of what the deal was there - similarly, it's 
probably worth this driver implementing it properly as well now (but 
that's really a separate patch).

Robin.
