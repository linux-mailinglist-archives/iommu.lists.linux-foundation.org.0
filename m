Sorry for very late response, and thank both for your comments.

Yes, enforcing the conditional check of force_dma_unencrypted() around
dma_free_from_pool sounds reasonable, just as we have done in
dma_alloc_from_pool().

I have tested this patchset on normal x86_64 systems and one amd system
with SME support, disabling atomic pool can fix the issue that there's no
managed pages in dma zone then requesting page from dma zone will cause
allocation failure. And even disabling atomic pool in 1st kernel didn't
cause any problem on one AMD EPYC system which supports SME. I am not
expert of DMA area, wondering how atomic pool is supposed to do in
SME/SEV system. 

Besides, even though atomic pool is disabled, slub page for allocation
of dma-kmalloc also triggers page allocation failure. So I change to
take another way to fix them, please check v2 post. The atomic pool
disabling an be a good to have change.

Thanks
Baoquan
