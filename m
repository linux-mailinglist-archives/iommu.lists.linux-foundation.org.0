I have tried to set it once at probe and then leave it in place, however
the NVMe driver does not seem to like it, and the VM does not boot
correctly. I have spent a couple days debugging but I am a bit lost
now.

Basically whenever nvme_setup_prp_simple
<https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.11-rc5/source/drivers/nvme/host/pci.c#L803>
is
mapping with the mask,
I am getting timeout issues on boot, which to my knowledge shows NVMe
driver failure:

I have checked that all the mappings happened correctly:

...

I have compared it to not setting the mask. The only difference in result is
that instead of being mapped to *200|* 400|*600 etc, they are all mapped
to *000. So I believe the mapping is done correctly, and according to NVMe
<https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM-Express-1_4b-2020.09.21-Ratified.pdf>
spec
<https://nvmexpress.org/wp-content/uploads/NVM-Express-1_4b-2020.09.21-Ratified.pdf>
figure
108/109, the mapping should have the offset kept. I am not
sure what caused the error that eventually led to the failure. Is there
another
bug in the NVMe driver?
