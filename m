Thanks to Will and Robin for reviewing this. I am pretty new to PCI,
sorry about that.
I assumed that the support for stream-id alias is already handled as
part of this patch:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg626087.html
which prevents STE re-initialization. But, what I do not understand is
why the path
taken by the arm-smmu-v3 driver misses the aforementioned check for my usecase.

The pci_endpoint_test picks up the same of_ DMA config node as the PCI RC
because they sit on the same PCI bus [via pci_dma_configure( )]
While in the arm-smmu-v3 driver, I can see that the pci_device_group( ) hands
over the same iommu group as the Root Complex to the newly added master
device (pci_endpoint_test in our case) because they share the same stream ID.
Shouldn't they?

I hope the support will be added soon. Also, can you point me to few drivers
which already handle this type of stream-ID aliasing?
