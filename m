I believe so. I'm not keen on having size only reservations in DT.
Yes, we allowed that already, but that's back from the days of needing
large CMA carveouts to be reserved early in boot. I've read that the
kernel is much better now at contiguous allocations, so do we really
need this in DT anymore?

We can have DT nodes for PCI. AIUI, IBM power systems always do. For
FDT, it's only if there are extra non-discoverable resources. It's
particularly fun when it's resources which need to be enabled for the
PCI device to be discovered. That seems to be a growing problem as PCI
becomes more common on embedded systems.
