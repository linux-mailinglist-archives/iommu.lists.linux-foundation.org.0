While I understand your reasoning above, and I tend to agree this would
be nice to have, I have spent some time looking at the algo to
merge/split/overlay regions and I am afraid that this will bring a huge
complexity in the insertion function (I am also afraid the existing data
structs may not be well adapted overall). So I am now a bit reluctant to
add such complexty for shrinking relaxable regions that we will
eventually ignore in any case.

Thanks
