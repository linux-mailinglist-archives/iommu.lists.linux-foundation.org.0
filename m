Agreed, certainly an IOMMU_DOMAIN_SVA type that can both encapsulate the 
mm and effectively replace iommu_sva seems like a logical and fairly 
small next step. We already have the paradigm of different domain types 
supporting different ops, so initially an SVA domain would simply allow 
bind/unbind rather than attach/detach/map/unmap.

It might then further be possible to hide SVA bind/unbind behind the 
attach/detach interface, but AFAICS we'd still need distinct flows for 
attaching/binding the whole device vs. attaching/binding to a PASID, 
since they are fundamentally different things in their own right, and 
the ideal API should give us the orthogonality to also bind a device to 
an SVA domain without PASID (e.g. for KVM stage 2, or userspace 
assignment of simpler fault/stall-tolerant devices), or attach PASIDs to 
regular iommu_domains.

That distinction could of course be consolidated by flipping to the 
other approach of explicitly allocating the PASID first, then wrapping 
it in a struct device that could then be passed through the same 
attach/detach interfaces and distinguished internally, but although I 
still have a fondness for that approach I know I'm about the only one :)

Cheers,
Robin.
