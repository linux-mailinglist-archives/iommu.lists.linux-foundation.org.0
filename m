As promised, here are some more details shared by camera team:

Mapping of a framework buffer happens at the time of process request and unmapping
of a framework buffer happens once the buffer is available from hardware and result
will be notified to camera framework.
 * When there is a delay in unmapping of a buffer, result notification to framework
   will be delayed and based on pipeline delay depth, new requests from framework
   will be delayed.
 * Camera stack uses internal buffer managers for internal and framework buffers.
   While mapping and unmapping these managers will be accessed, so uses common lock
   and hence is a blocking call. So unmapping delay will cause the delay for mapping
   of a new request and leads to framedrop.

Map and unmap happens in the camera service process context. There is no separate perf
path to perform unmapping.

In Camera stack along with map/unmap delay, additional delays are due to HW. So HW should
be able to get the requests in time from SW to avoid frame drops.

Thanks,
Sai
