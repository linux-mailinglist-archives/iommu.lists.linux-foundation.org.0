Right, the main concern is if the shiny new DT gets passed to an older 
kernel (or other OS entirely) which doesn't know the 
"nvdia,tegra194-smmu" compatible but would match on "arm,mmu-500" and 
bind a standard driver thinking it's going to work OK. The user would 
probably prefer that no driver matched and both instances were left 
turned off, than face the fallout of only one of them being set up.
