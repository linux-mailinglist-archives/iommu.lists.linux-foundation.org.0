FWIW, dma-direct should reject a mask if it doesn't cover at least the 
whole of ZONE_DMA; iommu-dma does allow anything, but that's because in 
principle it can make any mask down to PAGE_SIZE (or possibly even lower 
depending on the IOMMU) work. It's just that in that case the driver is 
liable to fill up the usable address space really really quickly :)

(I suppose technically it should be checking that masks at least cover 
more than the reserved PFN at IOVA 0, but meh...)

Either way, it still has little bearing on the benchmark itself. Say the 
user successfully sets an "acceptable" 21-bit DMA mask, but with 64K 
pages and >32 threads - the dma_map operations are still likely to start 
failing, and that failure is handled anyway, so why bother having an 
arbitrary and meaningless limit that only serves to make some unworkable 
cases fail slightly differently to others?

Anyway, this doesn't really matter - I see the patch is in -next already 
- it's just one of those things I can't help calling out on principle :)

Robin.
