I think we absolutely need some mechanism to make sure the PF driver
doesn't change the PASID enable bit while we're using it.  A PASID user
registration perhaps.  And yes, that doesn't necessarily map to being
able to actually disable PASID, but it sounds like Kevin and Ashok have
some ideas how the emulation could use the IOMMU settings to achieve
that more precisely.

Couldn't we do this with the DEVICE_FEATURE ioctl we just added?  A
user could set a PASID user or get a capability offset, where vfio-pci
would plumb these through to whatever PF/vendor driver provides that
interface, just as if it was implemented in the vfio-pci driver.  But
that still lets us leave the policy of inserting a capability and using
the IOMMU to implement the bits to the user/QEMU.  Thanks,

Alex
