Thanks a lot! for jumping in and providing your valuable insights :)
Sorry! for taking time to reply on this. Did some quick testing on
unbinding/binding stuff.

Agreed, maybe we could limit this feature only to PCIe devices :(

Yes, that makes sense.

We would like to propose something like this

1. User will first unbind the device driver by
echo "BDF" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/<device_driver>/unbind

2. Set the Pass Through bit (this is to say the intent of the user that upon
the next rebind, please make this device as pass through)
echo 1 > /sys/class/iommu/dmar0/devices/<BDF>/pt

3. Re-bind the driver again
echo "BDF" > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/<device_driver>/bind

So, if the driver doesn't support unbind then the user cannot put the device
in pass through mode, in which case he has to use kernel command line
argument.

I did unbind on my device that has root file system and after that I was
unable to run any command (like cat or echo), which made sense. So, it's upto
the user to decide which devices can go through unbind and hence can be put in
pass through mode. Since this feature requires sudo privileges, I think, we
can assume admin does the right thing.

Please let me know what you think about this and also please do suggest if you
have any other better ways to deal with this.

Regards,
Sai
