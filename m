My apologies for such a late reply, but I'm just getting around to
looking at this and I have a few questions on the basic design/flow
(below) ...

So I'm clear, at this point the combined stub+kernel+initramfs+cmdline
image has already been loaded into memory and the SL stub is
executing, yes?

As TrenchBoot seems to be focused on boot measurement and not
enforcing policy, I'm guessing this is considered out-of-scope (not to
mention that the combined stub+kernel image makes this less
interesting), but has any thought been given to leveraging the TXT
launch control policy, or is it simply an empty run-everything policy?

Since the stub+kernel image are combined it looks like the kernel
measurement comes from the ACM via the MLE measurement into PCR 18,
while the stub generated measurements are extended into PCR 19 or 20
depending on the configuration, yes?

I realize that moving the TXT code into the kernel makes this
difficult (not possible?), but one of the things that was nice about
the tboot based approach (dynamic, early launch) was that it could be
extended to do different types of measurements, e.g. a signing
authority measurement similar to UEFI Secure Boot and PCR 7.  If that
is possible, I think it is something worth including in the design,
even if it isn't initially implemented.  The only thing that
immediately comes to mind would be a section/region based approach
similar to systemd-boot/gummiboot where the (signed) kernel is kept in
a well known region and verified/measured by the stub prior to jumping
into its start point.

I'm sure there is some issue with passing data across boundaries, but
is there any reason why the TPM event log needs to be updated
out-of-sync with the TPM PCRs?  Is is possible to pass the
measurements to the SL platform module which would both extend the
PCRs and update the TPM event log at the same time?

It doesn't look like it's currently implemented, but it looks like
eventually you plan to support doing a new DRTM measurement on kexec,
is that correct?  I'm sure that is something a *lot* of people
(including myself) would like to see happen.
