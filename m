No, that's correct. 33 is a lot better than 1025 though. :) 1023 pages
is about the worst case if we assume we get 2MB blocks, but maybe not
a good assumption given our testing so far...

So thinking out loud, I guess we could iterate on power of 2 chunks of
size (in units of pages) like this:

while (size) {
  scale = fls(size);
  range = 1 << scale;
  size &= ~range;

  iova += range;
}

But that means NUM is always 0, so also not ideal. So we need to
extract 5 bits from size for NUM on each iteration:

while (size) {
  scale = __ffs(size);
  num = (size >> scale)) & 0x1f;
  size -= (num + 1) * (1 << scale);

  ...
}

So worst case, we'd have 4 invalidates for up to 4G.

Ok.
