Yes, it looks ugly, but the part I really have issues with is that building
QCOM_SCM=m and ARM_SMMU=y is perfectly fine if you don't run on an SoC
with the qcom implementation. I don't see why we need to enforce things
here beyond making sure that all selectable permutations _build_ and
fail gracefully at runtime on the qcom SoC if SCM isn't available.
