Hello Hanjun,

The patch only takes the address limit field into account if its value > 0.

Also, before commit 7fb89e1d44cb6aec ("ACPI/IORT: take _DMA methods
into account for named components"), the _DMA method was not taken
into account for named components at all, and only the IORT limit was
used, so I do not anticipate any problems with that.
