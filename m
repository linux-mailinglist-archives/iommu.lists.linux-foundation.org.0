Robin,

I have been working with Laurentiu on getting a proper implementation in place.
Based on the patchset you noted in [2] I have already added preliminary RMR
support to edk2 and have a working patchset for our HoneyComb using the LX2160a.

Laurentiu pointed me to the Nvidia patchset [1] which I had somehow missed in my
research.  That filled in quite a bit of the gap that [2] was missing
since it was
only implemented or the smmu_v3 driver.  I still need to finish merging the two
patchsets together for something fully functional but here are my observations.
If you have any preliminary input I would love to hear it.

 RMR's in ACPI and using the DT reserved_memory mappings seem to be
functionally achieving the same thing and just need different parsing methods
to collect the information.  Would there be objections to parsing DT and using
that to build the same rmr_list that was introduced in [2]?  Functionally we
are collecting the same information, the start address and length of the memory
region and then the SMMU IDs that are attached to it.

The main difference being that RMR's as you noted are spec'd for this so all
the information is neatly collected in the IORT table, while DT would require
parsing the reserved_memory regions tagged with the "active" property and
then loop through the devices to find the nodes using this memory region
and parsing out the SMMU information from that node.

Does this all seem reasonable?

Thanks,
Jon
