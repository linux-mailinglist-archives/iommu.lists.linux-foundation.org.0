The functionality of that series is subsumed by the patches I've posted
here, although if I can't get the cmpxchg() loop working well here then
we could revisit just making the change proposed by Robin. The problem is
that we'll still have serialisation on access to the command queue, and
therefore it will remain a scalability bottleneck as long as the fast-path
needs to queue for a lock.

However, I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve so I'm hoping to get a
new version of this lot out in the coming weeks.

Will
