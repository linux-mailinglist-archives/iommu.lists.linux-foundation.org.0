Keeping track of which queues a batch has touched is certainly possible, 
but it's yet more overhead to impose across the board when intra-batch 
preemption should (hopefully) be very rare in practice. I was thinking 
more along the lines of disabling preemption/migration for the lifetime 
of a batch, or more pragmatically just hoisting the queue selection all 
the way out to the scope of the batch itself (which also conveniently 
seems about the right shape for potentially forking off a whole other 
dedicated command submission flow from that point later).

We still can't mitigate inter-batch preemption, though, so we'll just 
have to audit everything very carefully to make sure we don't have (or 
inadvertently introduce in future) any places where that could be 
problematic. We really want to avoid over-syncing as that's liable to 
end up being just as bad for performance as the contention that we're 
nominally avoiding.

Indeed, plus once we start assigning queues to VMs we're going to want 
to remove them from the general pool for host usage, so we definitely 
want to plan ahead here.

Cheers,
Robin.
