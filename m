Because "platform" is not a real device type.  It's a catch-all for
devices that are only described by firmware, so why would you have a
virtual device for that?  Why would that be needed?

Ok, nevermind, you do have a virtual platform device, which personally,
I find crazy as why would firmware export a "virtual device"?

Ick.  Where does the DT file for these devices live that describe a
"virtual device" to match with this driver?

Safer how?

Ick, why?  AMBA needs to be a real bus type and use their own functions
if needed.  There is nothing here that makes this obvious that someone
else is using those functions and that the platform bus should only be
using these "new" functions.

That would be better than what is being proposed here.
