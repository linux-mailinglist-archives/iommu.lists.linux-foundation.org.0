Hmm, how about something like "dma_unmap_*_desc" for the context of the 
mapped DMA address also being used as a descriptor token?

AFAICS, even a full implementation of these APIs would have to be 
capable of returning an indication that there is no valid physical 
address - e.g. if unmap is called with a bogus DMA address that was 
never mapped. At that point there'sseemingly no problem just 
implementing the trivial case on top of any existing unmap/sync 
callbacks for everyone. I'd imagine that drivers which want this aren't 
likely to run on the older architectures where the weird IOMMUs live, so 
they could probably just always treat failure as unexpected and fatal 
either way.

In fact, I'm now wondering whether it's likely to be common that users 
want the physical address specifically, or whether it would make sense 
to return the original VA/page, both for symmetry with the corresponding 
map calls and for the ease of being able to return NULL when necessary.

Robin.
