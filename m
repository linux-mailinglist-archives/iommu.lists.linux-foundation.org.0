AFAIU On ARM the stage 2 table is uniquely defined per RID and the PASID
space is local to the RID. in other words all PASIDs used along with a
given RID share the same stage 2 page table. So the minimum granularity
for guest assignment still is the RID and not the PASID (there is no
scalable mode on ARM). on x86, with scalable mode, each RID/PASID can
have different stage1/stage2 tables which make the minimum granularity
for guest device assignment the PASID.

So on ARM the guest can allocate PASIDs without interfering with the
host. We just need to make sure the PASID table format and max entries
matches the capability of the HW.

If the min granularity for guest assignment were the RID/PASID
effectively a guest could steal all the PASIDs for a given RID.
