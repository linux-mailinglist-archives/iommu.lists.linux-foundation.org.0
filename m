What convinces you it's a false-positive? I'm hardly familiar with most 
of that callstack, but it appears to be related to mlx5, and I know that 
exists on expansion cards which could be plugged into a system with 
non-coherent PCIe where partial cacheline overlap *would* be a real 
issue. Of course it's dubious that there are many real use-cases for 
plugging a NIC with a 4-figure price tag into a little i.MX8 or 
whatever, but the point is that it *should* still work correctly.

The whole point of DMA debug is to flag up things that you *do* get away 
with on the vast majority of systems, precisely because most testing 
happens on those systems rather than more esoteric embedded setups. Say 
your system only uses dma-direct and a driver starts triggering the 
warning for not calling dma_mapping_error(), would you argue for 
removing that warning as well since dma_map_single() can't fail on your 
machine so it's "not a bug"?

According to the streaming DMA API documentation, it is *not* valid:

".. warning::

   Memory coherency operates at a granularity called the cache
   line width.  In order for memory mapped by this API to operate
   correctly, the mapped region must begin exactly on a cache line
   boundary and end exactly on one (to prevent two separately mapped
   regions from sharing a single cache line).  Since the cache line size
   may not be known at compile time, the API will not enforce this
   requirement.  Therefore, it is recommended that driver writers who
   don't take special care to determine the cache line size at run time
   only map virtual regions that begin and end on page boundaries (which
   are guaranteed also to be cache line boundaries)."

AFAICS they are different things. I believe the new warning is supposed 
to be for the fundementally incorrect API usage (as above) of mapping 
different regions overlapping within the same cacheline. The existing 
one is about dma-debug losing internal consistency when tracking the 
*same* region being mapped multiple times, which is a legal thing to do 
- e.g. buffer sharing between devices - but if anyone's doing it to 
excess that's almost certainly a bug (i.e. they probably intended to 
unmap it in between but missed that out).
