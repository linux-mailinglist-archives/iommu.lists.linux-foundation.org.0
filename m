Let me rephrase, I would be happy to help fix that problem if we really 
can get it fixed, however for my problem it's better to try to get the 
SCSI driver to stop requesting uncached IOVAs foremost.

Note that this is still not a final solution as it's not always viable 
to ask a user to unbind + bind the driver.

It would be great to see an improvement here...

ok, fine.

I agree that this change is in violation as the documentation clearly 
implies a hard limit.

However, FWIW, from looking at users of dma_max_mapping_size(), they 
seem to use in a similar way to SCSI/block layer core, i.e. use this 
value to limit the max SGL total len per IO command. And not as a method 
to learn max DMA consistent mappings size for ring buffers, etc.

Anyway I'll look at dma_opt_mapping_size() but I am not sure how keen 
Christoph will be on this... it is strange to introduce that API due to 
peculiarity of the IOVA allocator.
