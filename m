Right, there wouldn't be an upstream user, which would be problematic,
but I was thinking of having it so that when video or any of our other
clients that use this attribute on a per buffer basis upstreams their
code, it's not too much of a stretch to add the support.

I don't think that will work, because we currently have clients who use 
the
system cache as follows:
-cache only page tables in the system cache
-cache only data buffers in the system cache
-cache both page tables and all buffers in the system cache
-cache both page tables and some buffers in the system cache

The approach you're suggesting doesn't allow for the last case, as 
caching the
page tables in the system cache involves setting 
IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_ARM_OUTER_WBWA,
so we will end up losing the flexibility to cache some data buffers in 
the system cache.

Ideally, the page table quirk would drive the settings for the TCR, and 
the prot flag
drives the PTE for the mapping, as is done with the page table walker 
being dma-coherent,
while buffers are mapped as cacheable based on IOMMU_CACHE. Thoughts?

Isaac
