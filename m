I agree.

I've been going through over and over, hoping to perhaps be able to
evolve qcom_iommu into a qcom-iommu++, but afaict the new hypervisor is
different enough that this isn't feasible. In particular, the platforms
using qcom_iommu relies entirely on the hypervisor to configure stream
mapping etc - and we can't even read most of the registers.

On the other hand I agree with you that we're messing around quite a bit
with the arm-smmu driver, and I'm uncertain where we are on supporting
the various GPU features, so I'm adding Jordan to the thread.

So, afaict we have the options of either shoehorning this too into the
arm-smmu driver or we essentially fork arm-smmu.c to create a
qcom-smmu.c.

While I don't fancy the code duplication, it would allow us to revert
the Qualcomm quirks from arm-smmu and would unblock a number of
activities that we have depending on getting the SMMU enabled on various
platforms.


NB. As mentioned briefly before, "this" means: for a given compatible,
search SMR for a specific stream mapping and ensure it remains after
initialization and make sure the associated context bank is "allocated".

Agreed.
