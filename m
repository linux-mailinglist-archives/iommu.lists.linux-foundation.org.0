Ok, so it's not even a driver in the 5.4 kernel today, so there's
nothing I can do here as there is no regression of the existing source
tree.

Why pick a kernel that doesn not support the features they require?
That seems very odd and unwise.

Then they should move to 5.10 or newer as this just doesn't work on
older kernels, right?

If a feature in the kernel was not present on older kernels, trying to
shoe-horn it into them is not wise at all.  You pick a kernel version
to reflect the features/options that you require, and it sounds like 5.4
just will not work for them, so to stick with that would be quite
foolish.

Just move to 5.10, much simpler!
