The idea behind the impl hooks is to try to have them in logical places 
which should be suitable for multiple different workarounds (e.g. 
init_context is arranged to allow replacing smmu_domain->tlb_ops) - I 
want to avoid proliferating dozens of them that end up each being 
specific to individual workarounds, but that's not to say that the 
design we're starting with here is by any means complete or final. We're 
almost certainly going to evolve more hooks (and possibly adjust the 
current ones) in future.

As commented in the code, the setup for the existing quirks works out to 
be deceptively simple, and it can and will change. Ultimately I'm fully 
expecting to end up with complex logic hanging off arm_smmu_impl_init() 
to detect the integration details and compose sets of impl hooks in 
various ways as appropriate - I doubt that it's going to be practical or 
even possible to have static data for *every* possibility. The 
fundamental shape of the code is based on "model" quirks being more 
general than "integration" quirks, such that the latter should be in a 
position to dynamically inherit (or statically replace, in simple cases) 
the hooks of the former.

Other than that introducing QCOM_SMMU500 seems to be redundant, and 
whether it also needs ACPI-based detection, that certainly seems fairly 
reasonable for a simple isolated workaround. However, is the firmware 
call really a one-off probe-time thing? If the firmware does take care 
of preserving the wait-for-safe state across 
suspend/resume/hibernate/etc. then fair enough, but I would have assumed 
that the reset hook would be the more likely place to put it.

Robin.
