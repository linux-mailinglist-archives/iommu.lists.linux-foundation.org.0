I added everyone from the other thread, but somehow managed to miss
the Bjorn who sent the emails! Fixing that now.

Ah, thanks for explaining your scenario.

Ok, makes sense.

Maybe "inherit" makes it sound a lot more complicated than it is?
Bjorn will know the details of what the bootloader sets up. But
AFAICT, it looks like a simple "bypass"/identity mapping too. I don't
think it actually sets up page tables.

Yeah, I don't want to digress either. But as of now, iommus are
already supported.

If you can give additional details about this, I can give a better
answer. But with the limited info, there's one way I can think of to
handle this. To make the explanation easier, let's call the device
that references the IOMMU in DT as the "direct consumer device". The
driver __probe function__ for the direct consumer device can add a
device link from the composite device to the iommu device. This will
ensure the iommu device doesn't get the sync_state() callback before
the composite device probes. Keep in mind that devices do not need to
be probed to add device links between them. Only the supplier needs to
be registered with the driver framework to be able to add device links
to them.

With the suggestion I gave above, this might still work? I need more
details to be sure.

The regulator sync state implementation (when it's implemented) should
only prevent voltages from going down. Probably should do the same for
current.

If the consumer is trying to increase the voltage, it won't/shouldn't
be rejected. The sync_state() implementation only needs to keep the
minimum voltage to match what the bootloader left it on at. Voltage
can go anywhere from there to max allowed until sync_state() comes.

Example is fine. Documentation can be improved :)

No, the regulators that were off at kernel init won't/shouldn't be
forced to stay off. They shouldn't be limited in any way.

The above answer should clarify this.

Ok, makes sense. But I don't have the full details here. So I'll let
Bjorn comment here.

Looks like the most real scenarios are just different ways of setting
up identity-mapping or following "memory-regions". So, we don't have
to do a full fledged inheritance until someone actually needs them.

In your case, when mappings aren't set up, it looks like the IOMMU is
behaving like a pass-thru. In which case, it's "inherited mapping"
would be the identity-mapping.
