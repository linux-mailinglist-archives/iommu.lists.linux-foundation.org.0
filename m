I did had my 3970X lockup hard once on 5.16-rc2. It locked up completely without even
sending anything over a a pcie serial port card I. 

I don't remember what I was doing during the crash but probably had some VMs running.

Since then it didn't happen again, and I am running 5.16-rc3 for some time
with Paolo's kvm/queue merged and my own patches.

This is what I started doing last evening, and I'll go through all of the usual testing
I do soon.
