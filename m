Well:
 - Who maps memory into the IOASID (ie the specific sub stream id)?
 - What memory must be mapped?
 - Who triggers DMA to this memory?

If you are doing stuff like this then the /dev/ioasid is what you
actually want. The userprocess can create its own IOASID, program the
io page tables for that IOASID to point to pages as it wants and then
just hand over a fully instantiated io page table to the device
driver.

What you are describing is the literal use case of /dev/ioasid - a
clean seperation of managing the IOMMU related parts through
/dev/ioasid and the device driver itself is only concerned with
generating device DMA that has the proper PASID/substream tag.

The entire point is to not duplicate all the iommu code you are
describing having written into every driver that just wants an IOASID.

In particular, you are talking about having a substream capable device
and driver but your driver's uAPI is so limited it can't address the
full range of substream configurations:

 - A substream pointing at a SVA
 - A substream pointing a IO page table nested under another
 - A substream pointing at an IOMMU page table shared by many users

And more. Which is bad.

Somewhere in here:

Right, this is where /dev/ioasid is going.

However it gets worked out at the kAPI level in the iommu layer the
things you asked for are intended to be solved, and lots more.
