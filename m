Oh, the rest of the series looks great which is why I jumped on this bit!

Intriguing... Move the smp_wmb() into the IOVA code instead?

I'd have to see the patches, and I didn't look exhaustively at the current
stuff. But yes, I think the basic flow needs to be that there is an atomic
flag (i.e. cookie->fq_domain) which indicates which mode is being used
and if you flip that concurrently then you need to guarantee that everybody
is either using the old more or the new mode and not some halfway state in
between.
