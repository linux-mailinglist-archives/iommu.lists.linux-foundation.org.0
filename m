This is the place we started with..

But our solution was to provide an API which limits the allocation
range per device (dynamically) based on the driver request..
Something like,
    limit_iova_alloc_range(dev, low_iova, high_iova); /* via helpers */

When multiple devices use the same IOVA space, how we can handle api's
like " iova_alloc_low()" ?
And providing APIs like " limit_iova_alloc_range()" may cater similar
future requirements from drivers instead of worrying about
high/low/mid etc.

Again, flexibility should be there with user drivers to request the
range they want at any point of time...

Please let us know your inputs.
