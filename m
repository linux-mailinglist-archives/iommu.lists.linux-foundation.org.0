This commit log doesn't actually explain what you are chaning, and
as far as I can tell it just removes the code to change the domain
at run time, which seems to not actually match the subject or
description.  I'd need to look at the final code, but it seems like
this will still cause bounce buffering instead of using dynamic
mapping, which still seems like an awful idea.

Also from a purely stylistic perspective a lot of the lines seem
very short and not use up the whole 73 charaters allowed.
