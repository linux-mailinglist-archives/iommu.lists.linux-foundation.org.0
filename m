Right.. but I've not been convinced that having a /dev/iommu fd
instance be the boundary for these types of things actually makes
sense.  For example if we were doing the preregistration thing
(whether by child ASes or otherwise) then that still makes sense
across wildly different devices, but we couldn't share that layer if
we have to open different instances for each of them.

It really seems to me that it's at the granularity of the address
space (including extended RID+PASID ASes) that we need to know what
devices we have, and therefore what capbilities we have for that AS.

Right, but at this stage I'm just not seeing a really clear (across
platforms and device typpes) boundary for what things have to be per
IOASID container and what have to be per IOASID, so I'm just not sure
the /dev/iommu instance grouping makes any sense.

No... in the qemu case it would always select the page table format
that it needs to present to the guest.  That's part of the
guest-visible platform that's selected by qemu's configuration.

There's no negotiation here: either the kernel can supply what qemu
needs to pass to the guest, or it can't.  If it can't qemu, will have
to either emulate in SW (if possible, probably using a kernel-managed
IOASID to back it) or fail outright.

Again, I think you have the order a bit backwards.  The user selects
the capabilities that the vIOMMU will present to the guest as part of
the qemu configuration.  Qemu then requests that of the host kernel,
and either the host kernel supplies it, qemu emulates it in SW, or
qemu fails to start.

Guest visible properties of the platform never (or *should* never)
depend implicitly on host capabilities - it's impossible to sanely
support migration in such an environment.

Right, though it may be fall back to (partial) software emulation.  In
practice that would mean using a kernel-managed IOASID and walking the
guest IO pagetables itself to mirror them into the host kernel.

Nope.  Again, what devices share an IO address space is a guest
visible part of the platform.  If the host kernel can't supply that,
then qemu must not start (or fail the hotplug if the new device is
being hotplugged).

Yes.

Right.  But even in this case it needs to do some checking of the
capabilities of the backing IOMMU.  At minimum the host IOMMU needs to
be able to map all the IOVAs that the guest expects to be mappable,
and the host IOMMU needs to support a pagesize that's a submultiple of
the pagesize expected in the guest.

For this reason, amongst some others, I think when selecting a kernel
managed pagetable we need to also have userspace explicitly request
which IOVA ranges are mappable, and what (minimum) page size it
needs.

It should be possible *if* the backing IOMMU can support the necessary
IOVAs and pagesizes (and maybe some other things I haven't thought
of).  If not, you're simply out of luck and there's no option but to
fail to start the guest.
