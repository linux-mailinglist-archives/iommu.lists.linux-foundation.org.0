System memory or device memory, yes.

Corollary: The IOMMU group defines the minimum set of devices where the
IOMMU can control inter-device DMA.

Rule #1 is essentially the golden rule, the rest falls out from it.

The vfio group is simply a representation of the IOMMU group, which is
the minimum isolation granularity.  The group is therefore the minimum
security context, but itself is not a security context.  The overall
security context for vfio is the set of containers (IOMMU contexts)
owned by a user, where each container defines the IOMMU context for a
set of groups.  The user can map process and device memory between
containers within the same security context.

As you know, we have various issues with invalidation of device
mappings between containers, so simplifying the security context to the
ioasidfd seems like a good plan.  The vfio notion of a container is
already encompassed in the IOASID of the ioasidfd.

The significant difference is therefore the device level IOASID versus
vfio's group level container granularity.  This means the IOASID model
needs to incorporate the group model not only in terms of isolation,
but also address-ability.  The vfio model allows these to be combined
as a significant simplification.

As you note in reply to Kevin, in a multi-device group rule #1 can be
violated if only one device is connected to an IOASID.

Which is the root of my concern.  Who owns ioctls to the device fd?
It's my understanding this is a vfio provided file descriptor and it's
therefore vfio's responsibility.  A device-level IOASID interface
therefore requires that vfio manage the group aspect of device access.
AFAICT, that means that device access can therefore only begin when all
devices for a given group are attached to the IOASID and must halt for
all devices in the group if any device is ever detached from an IOASID,
even temporarily.  That suggests a lot more oversight of the IOASIDs by
vfio than I'd prefer.

"Who" within the kernel?  Is it the IOASID code itself or is this
another responsibility of vfio?  If IOASID knows about groups for this,
it's not clear to me why we have a device-level bind interface.  A
group-level bind interface clearly makes this more explicit.

As above, while the group is the minimum "security context" for vfio,
the overall security context is much more broad.  The group-level IOMMU
context is a simplification that allows us to combine isolation and
address-ability and so far it's not clear to me that the IOASID model
is also willing to take over these responsibility.  So again, if vfio
needs to manage these aspects that implies a lot of oversight of the
IOASID by vfio.

I can be done correctly, but if IOASID isn't willing to take on
responsibility of managing isolation of the group, then it implies a
non-trivial degree of management by users like vfio to make sure
userspace access is and remains secure.

If device access is usable after a BIND, then that suggests the IOASID
must be managing the group.  So why then do we have a device interface
for BIND rather than a group interface?

For example, given a group with devices A and B, the user performs a
BIND of deviceA_fd through vfio and now has access to device A.  The
user then performs BIND of deviceB_fd through vfio and has access to
device B.  BUT, something must have already taken on management of
device B in order to provide access to device A, so what's the point of
the BIND on device B?  Why isn't it a group interface?

So continuing the above example, releasing deviceA_fd does what at the
group level?  What if device A and B are DMA aliases of each other?
How does the group remain secure relative to userspace access via
device B?

Blocked by whom?  An IOMMU group assumes we cannot block DMA between
devices within the same group.  In vfio, even an unused devices that's
a member of an in-use group is placed into the IOMMU context of the
group, so a driver attaching to it that wants to do DMA will fail.

I'm really not seeing at all how this implicit group management is
supposed to work.  By making it implicit it's clearly too easily
ignored, by the user dependencies and the implementation proposal.
Thanks,

Alex
