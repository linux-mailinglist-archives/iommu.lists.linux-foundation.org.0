So unbind is coming anyway, the difference in handling in mmu release
notifier is whether we silently drop DMA fault vs. reporting fault?
If a process crash during unbind, something already went seriously
wrong, DMA fault is expected.
I think having some error indication is useful, compared to "silently
drop"
