What I understand from your reply is that the reset is not trivial work
and needs quite some time to be done properly; in that case: yes, please
add a TODO comment that explains the situation and the discussed solution.

Also, since this SLP_PROT_RDY flag seems to be very nice, just a simple
question: is this a new feature in the SMI IP of MT8186, or is there anything
similar that we may use on other SoCs, like 8183, 8192, 8195, as a follow-up
of this series?
