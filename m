 Umm, I use it with a 32-bit system, so it would be quite an issue for me 
to discover a problem with 64-bit configurations.  And I quite rely on 
this system for various stuff too!

 Thanks for the pointer and for cc-ing me.  Please refrain from removing 
the driver at least for this release cycle and let me fix it.  It should 
be easy to mimic what I did for the defza driver: all bus addresses in the 
DMA API come associated with virtual addresses, so it is just a matter of 
recording those somewhere for later use rather than trying to mess up with 
bus addresses to figure out a reverse mapping.
