Yes, it will be harder, especially for the _DMA methods.

The problem is that, while we are providing a full description of the
SoC's capabilities, we short circuit this by inserting knowledge into
the code (that is shared between all DT architectures) that
"brcm,bcm2711" is special, and needs a DMA zone override.

I think for ACPI boot, we might be able to work around this by cold
plugging the memory above 1 GB, but I have to double check whether it
won't get pulled into ZONE_DMA32 anyway (unless anyone can answer that
for me here from the top of their head)
