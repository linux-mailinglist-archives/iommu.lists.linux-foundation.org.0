First, thanks a lot for taking a look at this patch series.

The drivers would do streaming DMA within a reserved region that is
the only memory accessible to them for security reasons. This seems to
exactly match the definition of the restricted pool as merged
recently.

The new dma_alloc_noncontiguous() API would allow allocating suitable
memory directly from the pool, which would eliminate the need to copy.
However, for a restricted pool, this would exercise the SWIOTLB
allocator, which currently suffers from the limitation as described by
Hsin-Yi. Since the allocator in general is quite general purpose and
already used for coherent allocations as per the current restricted
pool implementation, I think it indeed makes sense to lift the
limitation, rather than trying to come up with yet another thing.

Best regards,
Tomasz
