Hello,
thank you all for looking into this! To answer some of the questions:
 - Did you have already some PoC fixes for this:
   We don't have a full PoC or fix currently. Thought we have a PoC
   with which were able to overwrite memory outside of the mapped
   dma region.
 - Is there a CVE associated with this?
   No
 - Is there a paper on this you all are working on?
   Yes, we were planning to use this bug (among others
   in a paper)

Could you point us to the intel thunder issue that you mentioned?
