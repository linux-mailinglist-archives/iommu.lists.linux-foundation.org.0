They're not at all common, but such systems do technically exist. It's 
hard to make them work in the current "one set of ops per bus" model, 
but I still have a long-term dream of sorting that out so such setups 
*can* be supported properly. I certainly wouldn't want to make any 
changes that completely close the door on that idea, but any static call 
optimisation that can be done in a config-gated manner should be viable 
for x86 at least. Even better if we could do it with a dynamic 
branch-patching solution that keeps the indirect case as a fallback; 
AFAICS that should be feasible to eagerly apply somewhere around 
iommu_device_register(), then just undo again if another driver ever 
does show up registering a new set of ops that don't match. I'm pretty 
confident that the systems where performance matters most are going to 
be sensible homogeneous ones - on the Arm side the SBSA should see to 
that. The weird mix-and-match cases are typically going to be FPGA 
prototyping systems and esoteric embedded stuff that are worlds away 
from worrying about keeping up with line rate on a 40GbE NIC...

Yes, now that we're starting to get things sufficiently consolidated 
behind iommu-dma that might be a reasonable thing to try, although given 
the amount of inherent work further down in the IOVA and IOMMU layers 
that dwarfs that of the direct case, I doubt that reducing the initial 
dispatch overhead would make any noticeable difference in practice.

Robin.
