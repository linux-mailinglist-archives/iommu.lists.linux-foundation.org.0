archid is a generic term. That's why you did not find it in the spec ;-)

On ARM SMMU the archid is called the ASID (Address Space ID, up to 16
bits. The ASID is stored in the Context Descriptor Entry (your PASID
entry) and thus characterizes a given stage 1 translation
"context"/"adress space".

At the moment the ASID is allocated per iommu domain. With aux domains
we should have one ASID per aux domain, Jean-Philippe said.

ASID tags IOTLB S1 entries. As the ASID is part of the "context
descriptor" which is owned by the guest, the API must pass it somehow.

4.4.1.2 CMD_TLBI_NH_ASID(VMID, ASID) invalidation command allows to
invalidate all IOTLB S1 entries for a given VMID/ASID and this is the
functionality which is currently missing in the API. This is not an
address based invalidation or a "pure" PASID based invalidation. At the
moment we don't support PASIDs on ARM and I need this capability.

Thanks

Eric
