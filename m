Hmm. Maybe just arch_dma_noncoherent_pgprot() then.

So this boils down to a terminology mismatch. The Arm architecture doesn't have
anything called "write combine", so in Linux we instead provide what the Arm
architecture calls "Normal non-cacheable" memory for pgprot_writecombine().
Amongst other things, this memory type permits speculation, unaligned accesses
and merging of writes. I found something in the architecture spec about
non-cachable memory, but it's written in Armglish[1].

pgprot_noncached(), on the other hand, provides what the architecture calls
Strongly Ordered or Device-nGnRnE memory. This is intended for mapping MMIO
(i.e. PCI config space) and therefore forbids speculation, preserves access
size, requires strict alignment and also forces write responses to come from
the endpoint.

I think the naming mismatch is historical, but on arm64 we wanted to use the
same names as arm32 so that any drivers using these things directly would get
the same behaviour.

Data coherency issues

Software can ensure the data coherency of caches in the following ways:

  * By not using the caches in situations where coherency issues can arise.
    This can be achieved by:

    - Using Non-cacheable or, in some cases, Write-Through Cacheable memory.

    - Not enabling caches in the system.

  * By using cache maintenance instructions to manage the coherency issues
    in software.

  * By using hardware coherency mechanisms to ensure the coherency of data
    accesses to memory for cacheable locations by observers within the
    different shareability domains.
