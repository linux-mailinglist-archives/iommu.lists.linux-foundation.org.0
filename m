The whole idea is that we already know we can't provide a *complete* TCR 
value (not least because anything above bit 31 is the wild west), thus 
there's really no point in io-pgtable trying to provide anything other 
than the parts it definitely controls. It makes sense to provide this 
partial TCR value "as if" for TTBR0, since that's the most common case, 
but ultimately io-pgatble doesn't know (or need to) which TTBR the 
caller intends to actually use for this table. Even if the caller *is* 
allocating it for TTBR0, io-pgtable doesn't know that they haven't got 
something live in TTBR1 already, so it still wouldn't be in a position 
to make the EPD1 call either way.

Ultimately, it's the IOMMU drivers who decide what they put in which 
TTBR, so it's the IOMMU drivers which have to take responsibility for 
EPD*. Sure you can worry about it, but you can equally worry about them 
them misprogramming the ASID or anything else...

Robin.
