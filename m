Sure, but unexpected changes in device state could happen for any number 
of reasons - uncorrected ECC error, surprise removal, etc. - so if that 
can affect "kernel integrity" I'm considering it an independent problem.

I can see the argument from that angle, but you can equally look at it 
another way and say that a device with kernel ownership is incompatible 
with a kernel driver, if userspace can call write() on 
"/sys/devices/B/resource0" such that device A's kernel driver DMAs all 
over it. Maybe that particular example lands firmly under "just don't do 
that", but I'd like to figure out where exactly we should draw the line 
between "DMA" and "ability to mess with a device".

No, it's definitely a general IOMMU-API-level thing; you could just as 
well have two drivers both trying to attach to their own unmanaged 
domains without DMA API involvement. What I think it boils down to is 
that if multiple devices in a group are bound (or want to bind) to 
different drivers, we want to enforce some kind of consensus between 
those drivers over IOMMU API usage.

iommu_attach_device() is supposed to be deprecated and eventually going 
away; I wouldn't look at it too much.

Indeed I wasn't imagining it changing any ownership, just preventing a 
group from being attached to a non-default domain if it contains devices 
bound to different incompatible drivers. Basically just taking the 
existing check that VFIO tries to enforce and formalising it into the 
core API. It's not too far off what we already have around changing the 
default domain type, so there seems to be room for it to all fit 
together quite nicely.

There would still need to be separate enforcement elsewhere to prevent 
new drivers binding *after* a group *has* been attached to an unmanaged 
domain, but again it can still be in those simplest terms. Tying it in 
to userspace and FDs just muddies the water far more than necessary.
