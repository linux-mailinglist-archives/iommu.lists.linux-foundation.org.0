Having considered the bitfield idea some more, I'm less attached to EPDx
because we simply wouldn't be making a statement about them, rather than a
(dangerous) zero value and expecting it to be ignored. So I think we're in
agreement on that.

The only part I'm still stuck to is that I think io-pgtable should know
whether it's targetting TTBR0 or TTBR1 so that it can sanitise input
addresses correctly. Doing this in the driver code is possible, but I'd
rather not start from that position, particularly as it would require things
like sign-extension in the TLBI callbacks.

I'm happy! :D:D:D
