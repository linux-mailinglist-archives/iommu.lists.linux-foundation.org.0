Yeah, if external_facing is set correctly then we can safely expect the 
the IOMMU layer to do the right thing, so in that case it probably is OK 
to infer that if an IOMMU is present for the NHI then it'll be managing 
that whole bus hierarchy. What I'm really thinking about here is whether 
we can defend against a case when external_facing *isn't* set, so we 
treat the tunnelled ports as normal PCI buses, assume it's OK since 
we've got an IOMMU and everything else is getting translation domains by 
default, but then a Thunderbolt device shows up masquerading the VID:DID 
of something that gets a passthrough quirk, and thus tricks its way 
through the perceived protection.

Robin.
