HW reports the originating device as far as it knows.  In many cases
where you have multiple devices in an IOMMU group, it's because
although they're treated as separate devices at the kernel level, they
have the same RID at the HW level.  Which means a RID for something in
the right group is the closest you can count on supplying.

And in that case I think we should call that object something other
than an IOASID, since it represents multiple address spaces.
