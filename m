Er, OK, if you're not interested in solving that problem I don't see why 
you'd bring it up, but hey ho. *I* still think it's important, so I 
guess I'll revive my old patch with a CONFIG_X86 bodge and have another 
go at some point.

FWIW I thought that all looked OK, it just kept getting drowned out by 
more critical things in my inbox so I hoped someone else might comment. 
If it turns out that I've become the de-facto IOVA maintainer in 
everyone else's minds now and they're all waiting for my word then fair 
enough, I just need to know and reset my expectations accordingly. Joerg?

Driver-specific mechanism; block-layer-specific mechanism; redefine this 
whole API to something like dma_opt_mapping_size(), as a limit above 
which mappings might become less efficient or start to fail (callback to 
my thoughts on [1] as well, I suppose); many options. Just not imposing 
a ridiculously low *maximum* on everyone wherein mapping calls "should 
not be larger than the returned value" when that's clearly bollocks.

Cheers,
Robin.
