For both DT and ACPI (or perhaps more accurately UEFI and non-UEFI) we
often don't have much/any control of the firmware.  In the UEFI case,
we can at least get the physical address of the scanout buffer from
EFI GOP (since VA=PA at that point).  In either case we could get the
iova by reading back controller state.  We kinda just need the iommu
driver to not change anything about the context bank the display is
using until the display driver is ready to install it's own
pagetables.

Initially I just want to shut down display, and then bring it back up
w/ my own pagetables.. but eventually, once iommu/clk/genpd issues are
sorted upstream, I'm planning to read out more completely the display
state, and remap the existing scanout buffer at same iova in my own
pagetables/iommu_domain, for a flicker-free display handover... that
is a lot more work but at least it is self contained in the display
(and bridge/panel) drivers.

I'd be pretty happy if we could convince qcom to use EFI GOP on
android devices too..

Although there is a lot more activity these days with people bringing
upstream support to various existing android phones/tablets.. and I'd
like to see that continue without downstream hacks due to lack of
control over firmware.

I was chatting last night w/ Bjorn on IRC.. and he mentioned that it
looked like TTBRn was 0x0.  Which I wasn't expecting, and I didn't
realize was a legit thing.  Maybe the purpose is to allow display to
access memory w/ iova==pa but disallow memory access from other
devices using different context banks of the same iommu?  Maybe this
makes more sense to you?

So, I guess in a DT world, we could have some boot-on; flag in the
device node.. that tells the iommu driver the stream-id(s) which might
be in use.  I guess the iommu driver would still need to map that back
to context bank, and then leave that CB and stream<->CB mapping alone.
But I think that would at least prevent "false positives", which I
think is what you are worrying about.

I'm not sure how this would work for ACPI, but tbh I haven't looked
yet at how iommu and device are connected w/ ACPI.

I'm not sure you can avoid having *some* amount of code in each iommu
driver, since the exact meaning of iommu-cells can be different.. but
I guess we could come up with a generic way of determining which
device(s) attached to an iommu might be active when the iommu driver
probes.

See above about TTBRn==null.. although if there were actually
pagetables, they would need to be reserved memory, otherwise I guess
windows would also have a problem w/ stomping pagetables.
