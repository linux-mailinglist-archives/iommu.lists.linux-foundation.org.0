FWIW the current semantics of dma_map_resource() are basically just to 
insert IOMMU awareness where dmaengine drivers were previously just 
casting phys_addr_t to dma_addr_t (or u32, or whatever else they put 
into their descriptor/register/etc.) IIRC there was a bit of a question 
whether it really belonged in the DMA API at all, since it's not really 
a "DMA" operation in the conventional sense, and convenience was the 
only real deciding argument. The relevant drivers at the time were not 
taking dma_pfn_offset into account when consuming physical addresses 
directly, so the new API didn't either.

That's just how things got to where they are today. Once again, I'm not 
saying that what we have now is necessarily right, or that your change 
is necessarily wrong, I just really want to understand specifically 
*why* you need to make it, so we can evaluate the risk of possible 
breakage either way. Theoretical "if"s aren't really enough.

Robin.
