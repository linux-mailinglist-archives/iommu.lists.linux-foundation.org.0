For the qemu case, I would imagine a two stage fallback:

    1) Ask for the exact IOMMU capabilities (including pagetable
       format) that the vIOMMU has.  If the host can supply, you're
       good

    2) If not, ask for a kernel managed IOAS.  Verify that it can map
       all the IOVA ranges the guest vIOMMU needs, and has an equal or
       smaller pagesize than the guest vIOMMU presents.  If so,
       software emulate the vIOMMU by shadowing guest io pagetable
       updates into the kernel managed IOAS.

    3) You're out of luck, don't start.
   =20
For both (1) and (2) I'd expect it to be asking this question *after*
saying what devices are attached to the IOAS, based on the virtual
hardware configuration.  That doesn't cover hotplug, of course, for
that you have to just fail the hotplug if the new device isn't
supportable with the IOAS you already have.

One can imagine optimizations where for certain intermediate cases you
could do a lighter SW emu if the host supports a model that's close to
the vIOMMU one, and you're able to trap and emulate the differences.
In practice I doubt anyone's going to have time to look for such cases
and implement the logic for it.

No, this fundamentally misunderstands the qemu model.  The user
*chooses* the guest visible platform, and qemu supplies it or fails.
There is no negotiation with the guest, because this makes managing
migration impossibly difficult.

-cpu host is an exception, which is used because it is so useful, but
it's kind of a pain on the qemu side.  Virt management systems like
oVirt/RHV almost universally *do not use* -cpu host, precisely because
it cannot support predictable migration.
