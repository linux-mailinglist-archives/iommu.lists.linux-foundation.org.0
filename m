For "un-enlightened" guest, there is an another system running insider
the VM to emulate some functions(tsc, timer, interrupt and so on) and
this helps not to modify OS(Linux/Windows) a lot. In Hyper-V Isolation
VM, we called the new system as HCL/paravisor. HCL runs in the VMPL0 and 
Linux runs in VMPL2. This is similar with nested virtualization. HCL
plays similar role as L1 hypervisor to emulate some general functions
(e.g, rdmsr/wrmsr accessing and interrupt injection) which needs to be
enlightened in the enlightened guest. Linux kernel needs to handle
#vc/#ve exception directly in the enlightened guest. HCL handles such
exception in un-enlightened guest and emulate interrupt injection which
helps not to modify OS core part code. Using vTOM also is same purpose.
Hyper-V uses vTOM avoid changing page table related code in OS(include
Windows and Linux)and just needs to map memory into decrypted address
space above vTOM in the driver code.

Linux has generic swiotlb bounce buffer implementation and so introduce
swiotlb_unencrypted_base here to set shared memory boundary or vTOM.
Hyper-V Isolation VM is un-enlightened guest. Hyper-V doesn't expose 
sev/sme capability to guest and so SEV code actually doesn't work.
So we also can't interact current existing SEV code and these code is
for enlightened guest support without HCL/paravisor. If other platforms
or SEV want to use similar vTOM feature, swiotlb_unencrypted_base can
be reused. So swiotlb_unencrypted_base is a general solution for all
platforms besides SEV and Hyper-V.
