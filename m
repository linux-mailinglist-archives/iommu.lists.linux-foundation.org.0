Sorry, I seem to have overlooked those comments.

I will go ahead and address them. I think it might be ideal to try to do
as much work as possible in the io-pgtable level, so as to minimize the 
number
of indirect calls incurred by jumping back and forth between iommu fwk, 
iommu
driver, and io-pgtable code.

Perhaps we can try something like how the linear mappings are created on 
arm64 i.e.
on the previous level, we can determine how many pages can be unmapped 
in one page table
in one iteration, and on the subsequent iterations, we can tackle 
another page table at
the lower level. Looking at the code, it doesn't seem too difficult to 
add this in. Thoughts?

Thanks,
Isaac
