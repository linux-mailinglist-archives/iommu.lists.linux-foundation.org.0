Robin,

Thanks for the response. I don't care too much about supporting new
kernels with the current DT - I'm good with fixing this with a DT
change. Would you be able to give me an example? I would love to see
Cavium mainline an cn81xx dts/dtsi in arch/arm64/boot/dts to be used
as a base as the only thing we have to go off of currently is the
Cavium SDK which has fairly old kernel support.

Thanks,

Tim
