It would be good to understand why the rcache doesn't stabilize. Could be
a bug, or just need some tuning

In strict mode, if a driver does Alloc-Free-Alloc and the first alloc
misses the rcache, the second allocation hits it. The same sequence in
non-strict mode misses the cache twice, because the IOVA is added to the
flush queue on Free. 

So rather than AFAFAF.. we get AAA..FFF.., only once the fq_timer triggers
or the FQ is full. Interestingly the FQ size is 2x IOVA_MAG_SIZE, so we
could allocate 2 magazines worth of fresh IOVAs before alloc starts
hitting the cache. If a job allocates more than that, some magazines are
going to the depot, and with multi-CPU jobs those will get used on other
CPUs during the next alloc bursts, causing the progressive increase in
rcache consumption. I wonder if setting IOVA_MAG_SIZE > IOVA_FQ_SIZE helps
reuse of IOVAs?

Then again I haven't worked out the details, might be entirely wrong. I'll
have another look next week.

Thanks,
Jean
