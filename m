Indeed, that's certainly something I'm planning to investigate as a 
future refactoring step.

...and now there's a rough WIP branch here:

http://linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-rm.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/iommu/pgtable

I'll finish testing and polishing those patches at some point next week, 
probably, but hopefully they're sufficiently illustrative for the moment.
