Hi Bjorn,

Since it's a device about tuning and analyzing PCIe link in your realm and you've given
helpful comments in RFC and v1 version, looking forward to see your opnion on this
driver as the user interface has changed to perf. Also to confirm that the hotplug problem
mentioned in RFC[1] has been resolved in a proper way.

Thanks.
