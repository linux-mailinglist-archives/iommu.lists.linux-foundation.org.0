No, please please no.

If a bus really wants to do crud like this, it can do it in it's own
probe callback, the driver core doesn't need to mess with this.

If you need to mess with iommu values in struct device, again, do that
in the bus core for the devices on that specific bus, that's where those
values are supposed to be set anyway, right?

If the iommu drivers need to be run before a specific bus is
initialized, then fix that there, the driver core does not need to care
about this at all.

so a big NACK on this one, sorry.
