Thanks for your response. Understood that you are not responding
about the middle commit (c062db039f40).

However, that's a pretty small and straightforward change, so I've
experimented a bit with that. Commenting out the new code there, I
get some relief:

	Children see throughput for 12 initial writers 	= 4266621.62 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 12 initial writers 	= 4254756.31 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  354847.75 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  356167.59 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  355551.80 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 1044736.00 kB
	CPU Utilization: Wall time    2.951    CPU time    1.981    CPU utilization  67.11 %


	Children see throughput for 12 rewriters 	= 4314827.34 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 12 rewriters 	= 4310347.32 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  358599.72 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  360319.06 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  359568.95 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 1043968.00 kB
	CPU utilization: Wall time    2.912    CPU time    2.057    CPU utilization  70.62 %


	Children see throughput for 12 readers 		= 4614004.47 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 12 readers 		= 4609014.68 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  382414.81 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  388519.50 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  384500.37 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 1032192.00 kB
	CPU utilization: Wall time    2.701    CPU time    1.900    CPU utilization  70.35 %


	Children see throughput for 12 re-readers 	= 4653743.81 kB/sec
	Parent sees throughput for 12 re-readers 	= 4647155.31 kB/sec
	Min throughput per process 			=  384995.69 kB/sec 
	Max throughput per process 			=  390874.09 kB/sec
	Avg throughput per process 			=  387811.98 kB/sec
	Min xfer 					= 1032960.00 kB
	CPU utilization: Wall time    2.684    CPU time    1.907    CPU utilization  71.06 %

I instrumented the code to show the "before" and "after" values.

The value of domain->domain.geometry.aperture_end on my system
before this commit (and before the c062db039f40 code) is:

144,115,188,075,855,871 = 2^57

The c062db039f40 code sets domain->domain.geometry.aperture_end to:

281,474,976,710,655 = 2^48

Fwiw, this system uses the Intel C612 chipset with Intel(R) Xeon(R)
E5-2603 v3 @ 1.60GHz CPUs.


My sense is that "CPU time" remains about the same because the problem
isn't manifesting as an increase in instruction path length. Wall time
goes up, CPU time stays the same, the ratio of those (ie, utilization)
drops.
