In this case it's the abstractions that are the problem, though. Any 
driver which supports heterogeneous IOMMU instances with potentially 
differing page sizes currently has no choice but to do horrible bodges 
to make the bus-based iommu_domain_alloc() paradigm work *at all*. 
Fixing that from the fundamental API level upwards has been on the to-do 
list for some time now, but won't be straightforward.
