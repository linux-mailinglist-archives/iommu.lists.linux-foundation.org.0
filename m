I acked the first one

Robin reviewed the second
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/e6c812d6-0cad-4cfd-defd-d7ec427a6538@arm.com)
(though I do agree with his comment about DMA_BIT_MASK()), Joerg was OK
with it if Robin was
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190423145721.GH29810@8bytes.org).

Eric reviewed the third (and pointed out a typo).

My Kconfiggery never got fully answered -- it looks to me as though it's
possible to build pcie-iproc without the DMA hole support, and I thought
the whole point of this series was to deal with those holes
(https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190418234241.GF126710@google.com).  I would
have expected something like making pcie-iproc depend on IOMMU_SUPPORT.
But Srinath didn't respond to that, so maybe it's not an issue and it
should only affect pcie-iproc anyway.

So bottom line, I'm fine with merging it for v5.2.  Do you want to merge
it, Lorenzo, or ...?

Bjorn
