While amdgpu and radeon do seem to use this to trigger DMA32
allocations, the bool return value doesn't really tell if DMA32 is
helpful or not. All it tells is that the system has memory outside of
the device dma addressing capabilities.

Is the return value of this function correct if the device is behind a
IOMMU? While the device might be on a bus that is address limited a
IOMMU further up the path to memory might allow to address all system
memory, no?

Regards,
Lucas
