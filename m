Here is the example of setting the MPU:

Right, but applying bounce buffering to RX will make it more secure.
The device won't be able to modify the content after unmap. Just like what
iommu_unmap does.

I'm not sure, but actually, enabling the default swiotlb for wifi also helps the
throughput a little bit for me.
