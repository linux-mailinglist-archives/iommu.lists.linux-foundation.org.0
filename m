Thank you very much for your feedback, Thomas. I am sorry it took me a

Thank you for the clarification. I think I meant to say that there is a
request_nmi() function but AFAIK it is only used in the ARM PMU and
would not work on x86.

Using request_irq() plus a HPET quirk looked to me a reasonable
way to use the irqdomain hierarchy to allocate an interrupt with NMI as
the delivery mode.

I am sorry Thomas, I did try to make the quirk less hacky but I did not
think of the solution you provide below.

Thanks for the detailed demonstration! It does seem cleaner than what I
implemented.

Indeed, I focused on 5) and I overlooked your comment on using your
new support for shortand IPIs.

I'll go back and see to implement option #2, or perhaps the alternative
solution you proposed on a separate thread.

Thanks and BR,
