No the device driver just waits for the device to indicate that it has
completed the sequence. That's what the magic stop-PASID mechanism
described by PCIe does. In 6.20.1 "Managing PASID TLP Prefix Usage" it
says:

"A Function must have a mechanism to request that it gracefully stop using
 a specific PASID. This mechanism is device specific but must satisfy the
 following rules:
 [...]
 * When the stop request mechanism indicates completion, the Function has:
   [...]
   * Complied with additional rules described in Address Translation
     Services (Chapter 10 [10.4.1.2 quoted above]) if Address Translations
     or Page Requests were issued on the behalf of this PASID."

So after the device driver initiates this mechanism in the device, the
device must be able to indicate completion of the mechanism, which
includes completing all in-flight Page Requests. At that point the device
driver can call unbind() knowing there is no pending PR for this PASID.

Thanks,
Jean
