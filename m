Hi Palmer,
This series doesn't implement the PBMT extension which is still in discussion.
It simply reuse the existing non-coherent dma mapping support in
upstream kernel and enable
it for RISC-V. The current version uses a non-coherent global pool. I
will update it to use arch_set_uncached
as per Christoph's suggestion. It solves the non-coherent DMA problem
for beagleV and not c906.

I briefly mentioned the PBMT extension just to provide an idea how the
RISC-V Linux kernel
can support both unached window and PBMT extension. PBMT extension is
planned to be frozen
by the end of this year and none of the hardware has implemented it.

The implementation in c906 is a non-standard one and will not be
supported by the default PBMT
extension implementation.

I am not sure whom you have talked to. I would be happy to set up a
meeting so that everybody is on
the same page if you are getting different answers every time.
