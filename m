Hi Thierry,

I happened upon this thread while looking into another thread [1].

While I'm not an expert on IOMMUs, I have a decent high level
understanding of the problem you are trying to solve.

I'm not sure if this RFC will solve the splash screen issue across SoCs
([1] seems to have a different issue and might not have memory-regions).

You are in luck! I added sync_state() driver callbacks [2] exactly for
cases like this. Heck, I even listed IOMMUs as an example use case. :)
sync_state() works even with modules if one enables of_devlink [3] kernel
parameter (which already supports iommus DT bindings). I'd be happy to
answer any question you have on sync_state() and of_devlink.

Good foresight. As [1] shows, identity mapping doesn't solve it in a
generic way.

How about actually reading the current settings/mappings and just
inheriting that instead of always doing a 1:1 identity mapping? And then
those "inherited" mappings can be dropped when you get a sync_state().
What's wrong with that option?

Cheers,
Saravana
