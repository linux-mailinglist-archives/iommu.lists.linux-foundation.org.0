Yeah, I was just looking at the final puzzle piece of making sure to nab 
the actual VFIO device rather than some unbound device that's just along 
for the ride... If I can't come up with anything more self-contained 
I'll take this suggestion, thanks.

Oh, I rather assumed that VFIO might automatically tear down the 
container/domain when the last real user disappears. I don't see there 
being an obvious problem if the domain does hang around with residual 
non-VFIO devices attached until userspace explicitly closes all the 
relevant handles, as long as we take care not to release DMA ownership 
until that point also. As you say, it just looks a bit funny.

I think domain lifecycle management is already entirely up to the users 
and not something that IOMMU drivers need to worry about. Drivers should 
only need to look at per-device data in attach/detach (and, once I've 
finished, alloc) from the device argument which can be assumed to be 
valid at that point. Otherwise, all the relevant internal data for 
domain ops should belong to the domain already.

Cheers,
Robin.
