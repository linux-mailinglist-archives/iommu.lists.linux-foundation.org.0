As far as I can tell the x86 version of xen_swiotlb_detect has a
!CONFIG_XEN stub.  The arm/arm64 version in uncoditionally declared, but
the implementation only compiled when Xen support is enabled.

Well, right now SWIOTLB_NO_FORCE is checked in dma_direct_map_page.
We need to clean all this up a bit, especially with the work to support
multiple swiotlb buffers, but I think for now this is the best we can
do.

So I'd like to change the core swiotlb initialization to just use
a callback into the arch/xen code to make the pages contigous and
kill all that code duplication.  Together with the multiple swiotlb
buffer work I'd rather avoid churn that goes into a different direction
if possible.
