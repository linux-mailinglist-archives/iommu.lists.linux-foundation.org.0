Think about the case in which the system gets resumed only partially due to a

failure during resume of some driver, or due to a RTC or arch timer resume and
suspend right after... or perhaps during runtime suspend/resume of some devices.
In that case, we definitely want to avoid any kind of failure point that would
lead to a system crash, or any kind of user noticeable (or UX disrupting) "strange
behavior".

I think that we should make sure that the system suspends cleanly, instead of
patching up any possible leftover issue at resume time: if this is doable with
a LARB reset in suspend error case, that looks like being a good option indeed.

As a side note, thinking about UX, losing a little more time during suspend is
nothing really noticeable for the user... on the other hand, spending more time
during resume may be something noticeable to the user.
For this reason, I think that guaranteeing that the system resumes as fast as
possible is very important, which adds up to the need of suspending cleanly.
