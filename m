Sorry, I don't quite follow the numbers here. Why does the number of queues
affect the classic "CMDQ" mode? We only have one queue there, right?

I'd certainly prefer to wait until we have something we know is
representative. However, I can take the first four prep patches now if you
respin the second one. At least that's then less for you to carry.

I'd also like review from the Arm side on this (and thank you for adopting
the architecture unlike others seem to have done judging by the patches
floating around).
