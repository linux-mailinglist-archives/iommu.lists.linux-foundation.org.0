Yes

Yes, but we can't get from one of these to the other atomically wrt to
the device DMA.

If your goal is to prioritize IO page table sharing, sure.  But because
we cannot atomically transition from one to the other, each device is
stuck with the pages tables it has, so the history of the VM becomes a
factor in the performance characteristics.

For example if device {A} is backed by an IOMMU capable of blocking
no-snoop and device {B} is backed by an IOMMU which cannot block
no-snoop, then booting VM1 with {A,B} and later removing device {B}
would result in ongoing wbinvd emulation versus a VM2 only booted with
{A}.

Type1 would use separate IO page tables (domains/ioasids) for these such
that VM1 and VM2 have the same characteristics at the end.

Does this become user defined policy in the IOASID model?  There's
quite a mess of exposing sufficient GET_INFO for an IOASID for the user
to know such properties of the IOMMU, plus maybe we need mapping flags
equivalent to IOMMU_CACHE exposed to the user, preventing sharing an
IOASID that could generate IOMMU faults, etc.

I think more to drive the replacement design; if we can't figure out
how to do something other than backwards compatibility trickery in the
kernel, it's probably going to bite us.  Thanks,

Alex
