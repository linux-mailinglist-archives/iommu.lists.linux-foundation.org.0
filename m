That's ideal, thanks - exactly the sequence I was hoping for.

(Another shortcoming in debug_dma_assert_idle(), that I hadn't wanted
to distract us by mentioning, is that it assumed that the mapping is
contained within one small page, whereas I believe one or more of the
DMA mapping functions take a size_t argument, that could in theory span
small pages - I guess more plausible inside a compound page; yet it
looked like only an initial entry would be put into the radix-tree.)

Yes, you're right to hold back.

I'd been looking there too (but backed off while speeding up the
fork was causing the "Hugh load" to "fail": it's the exit that now
wants speeding up, to please that test).  I think it could well avoid
getting into page locking when mapcount is quickly seen to be high
(> 1? > 2? > bigger? I never did the logic), but the page locking
becomes important when mapcount looks low, yet swap might be involved.

We used to rely on page count there, and on trylock_page() only; but
there was at least one user whose app went wrong when occasionally we
COWed the page, just because something else momentarily took a reference
to it, or locked it.  Around 2006, bug report from 2004: I did look up
the history a week ago, but was interrupted before taking notes.
