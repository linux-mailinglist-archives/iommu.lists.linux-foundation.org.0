I see in general 2 use cases here:


1) Allow for a generic mechanism to have the fully system, individual 
buses, devices or functions of a device go through a particular, 
self-contained bounce buffer.

This sounds like the holy grail to a lot of problems. It would solve 
typical embedded scenarios where you only have a shared SRAM. It solves 
the safety case (to some extent) where you need to ensure that one 
device interaction doesn't conflict with another device interaction. It 
also solves the problem I've tried to solve with the patch here.

It's unfortunately a lot harder than the patch I sent, so it will take 
me some time to come up with a working patch set.. I suppose starting 
with a DT binding only is sensible. Worst case, x86 does also support DT ...

(And yes, I'm always happy to review patches if someone else beats me to it)


2) Reuse the SWIOTLB from the previous boot on kexec/kdump

I see little direct relation to SEV here. The only reason SEV makes it 
more relevant, is that you need to have an SWIOTLB region available with 
SEV while without you could live with a disabled IOMMU.

However, I can definitely understand how you would want to have a way to 
tell the new kexec'ed kernel where the old SWIOTLB was, so it can reuse 
its memory for its own SWIOTLB. That way, you don't have to reserve 
another 64MB of RAM for kdump.

What I'm curious on is whether we need to be as elaborate. Can't we just 
pass the old SWIOTLB as free memory to the new kexec'ed kernel and 
everything else will fall into place? All that would take is a bit of 
shuffling on the e820 table pass-through to the kexec'ed kernel, no?


Thanks,

Alex
