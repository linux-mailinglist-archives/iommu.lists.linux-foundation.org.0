This line is the problem.

[Historical aside: Alex's early drafts for the VFIO interface looked
quite similar to this.  Ben Herrenschmidt and myself persuaded him it
was a bad idea, and groups were developed instead.  I still think it's
a bad idea, and not just for POWER]

As Alex says, if this line fails because of the group restrictions,
that's not great because it's not very obvious what's gone wrong.  But
IMO, the success path on a multi-device group is kind of worse:
you've now made made a meaningful and visible change to the setup of
devices which are not mentioned in this line *at all*.  If you've
changed the DMA address space of this device you've also changed it
for everything else in the group - there's no getting around that.

For both those reasons, I absolutely agree with Alex that retaining
the explicit group model is valuable.

Yes, it makes set up more of a pain, but it's necessary complexity to
actually understand what's going on here.
