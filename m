That is the primary motivation, given that we have moved to 1st level for
general IOVA, first level doesn't have a WO mapping. I didn't know enough
about the history to determine if a WO without a READ is very useful. I
guess the ZLR was invented to support those cases without a READ in PCIe. I

Early Intel IOMMU's didn't handle ZLR properly, until we fixed it in the
next generation. It just seemed opposite to the CPU page-tables, and we
wanted to have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't
want things to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same
mappings.

Hope this helps

Cheers,
Ashok
