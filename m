But isn't that just as true for the currently-supported case? All you 
need is a large enough Thunderbolt enclosure and you could suddenly plug 
in a dozen untrusted GPUs all wanting to map hundreds of megabytes of 
memory. If there's a real concern worth addressing, surely it's worth 
addressing properly for everyone.

Yup, back when the bounce-buffering stuff first came up I know 
networking folks were interested in terms of latency for small packets - 
virtualised IOMMUs are indeed another interesting case I hadn't thought 
of. It's definitely been on the radar as another use-case we'd like to 
accommodate with the bounce-buffering scheme. However, that's the thing: 
bouncing is bouncing and however you look at it it still overlaps so 
much with the untrusted case - there's no reason that couldn't use 
pre-mapped bounce buffers too, for instance - that the only necessary 
difference is really the policy decision of when to bounce. iommu-dma 
has already grown complicated enough, and having *three* different ways 
of doing things internally just seems bonkers and untenable. Pre-map the 
bounce buffers? Absolutely. Dynamically grow them on demand? Yes please! 
Do it all as a special thing in its own NIH module and leave the 
existing mess to rot? Sorry, but no.

Thanks,
Robin.
