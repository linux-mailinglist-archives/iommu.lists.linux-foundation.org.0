Hello; I installed the patch on v5.2, verified by eye it got applied, 
recompiled, and found no change; that is, the video stream doesn't display.

I also went back and verified my known good v4.20-rc4 kernel still 
worked, and my known bad v4.20-rc4 stayed bad. No changes.

I will note that the video has once or twice but extremely rarely had 
started on the bad kernels; maybe a timing or race, or somehow being set 
up from a previous boot; I try to power off between tests to make sure 
system starts from a known, uncontaminated environment.
