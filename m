I'm struggling to see how this is not simply indicative of a leak 
originating elsewhere. For the number of magazines to continually grow, 
it means IOVAs *of a particular size* are being freed faster than they 
are being allocated, while the only place that ongoing allocations 
should be coming from is those same magazines!

Now indeed that could happen over the short term if IOVAs are allocated 
and freed again in giant batches larger than the total global cache 
capacity, but that would show a cyclic behaviour - when activity starts, 
everything is first allocated straight from the tree, then when it ends 
the caches would get overwhelmed by the large burst of freeing and start 
having to release things back to the tree, but eventually that would 
stop once everything *is* freed, then when activity begins again the 
next round of allocating would inherently clear out all the caches 
before going anywhere near the tree. To me the "steady decline" 
behaviour suggests that someone somewhere is making DMA unmap calls with 
a smaller size than they were mapped with (you tend to notice it quicker 
the other way round due to all the device errors and random memory 
corruption) - in many cases that would appear to work out fine from the 
driver's point of view, but would provoke exactly this behaviour in the 
IOVA allocator.
