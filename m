Ah yes, my bad, for some reason I got the misapprehension into my head 
that untrusted was propagated to the port as well, not just the devices 
behind it. I'll fix this and tweak the comment below to match.

Ack. I'll wait and send a v3 once the merge window's over, and can roll 
Mario's AMD IOMMU patch into that too.

Thanks,
Robin.
