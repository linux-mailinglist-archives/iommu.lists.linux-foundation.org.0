Sorry to nitpick, but I think it's important to get terminology right 
here to avoid unnecessary misunderstanding. You can't map memory into an 
address space ID; it's just a number. Ultimately that identifier ends up 
pointing at some actual address space, and most of the current work is 
focused on the case of that address space being provided by an mm where 
things are mapped implicitly by a userspace process; I care about the 
case of it being provided by an iommu_domain where things are mapped 
explicitly by a kernel driver. I would be extremely wary of creating 
some new third *address space* abstraction.

It's a pretty typical DMA flow, as far as I understand. Userspace 
allocates some buffers (in this case, via the kernel driver, but in 
general I'm not sure it makes much difference), puts data in the 
buffers, issues an ioctl to say "process this data", and polls for 
completion; the kernel driver makes sure the buffers are mapped in the 
device address space (at allocation time in this case, but in general I 
assume it could equally be done at request time for user pages), and 
deals with scheduling requests onto the hardware. I understand this 
interface is already deployed in a driver stack which supports a single 
client process at once; extending the internals to allow requests from 
multiple processes to run in parallel using Substream IDs for isolation 
is the future goal. The interface itself shouldn't change, only some 
internal arbitration details.

No. In our case, the device does not need to operate on userspace 
addresses, in fact quite the opposite. There may need to be additional 
things mapped into the device address space which are not, and should 
not be, visible to userspace. There are also some quite weird criteria 
for optimal address space layout which frankly are best left hidden 
inside the kernel driver. Said driver is already explicitly managing its 
own iommu_domain in the same manner as various DRM drivers and others, 
so growing that to multiple parallel domains really isn't a big leap. 
Moving any of this responsibility into userspace would be unwanted and 
unnecessary upheaval.

None of which make much if any sense for the way this device and the 
rest of its software stack are designed to work, though. Anyway, the 
actual uAPI in question is essentially just chucking buffer fds about in 
a very abstract manner, so I don't see that it has any relevance here. 
We're talking about a kernel driver *internally* managing how it chooses 
to expose the buffers backing those fds to the hardware. SVA has no 
meaning in that context (there's nothing to share), and I don't even 
understand your second case, but attaching multiple SSIDs to a single 
domain is absolutely something which _could_ be done, there's just zero 
point in a single driver doing that privately when it could simply run 
the relevant jobs under the same SSID instead.

Thanks, along with our discussion here that kind of confirms my concern. 
Assuming IOASID can wrap up a whole encapsulated thing which is either 
SVA or IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA is too much of an overabstraction. There 
definitely *are* uses for IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA - say you want to put some 
SIOV ADIs to work for the host kernel using their regular 
non-IOMMU-aware driver - but there will also be cases for 
IOMMU_DOMAIN_UNMANAGED, although I do mostly expect those to be SoC 
devices whose drivers are already IOMMU-aware and just want to be so at 
a finer-grained level, not PCI devices. Even IOMMU_DOMAIN_PASSTHROUGH 
for IOASIDs _could_ be doable if a sufficiently compelling reason came 
along. I agree that SVA on init_mm is pretty bonkers, but don't get too 
hung up on the DMA API angle which is really orthogonal - passthrough 
domains with dma-direct ops have been working fine for years.

Great! It feels like one of the major things will be that, at least 
without major surgery to the DMA API, most of the use-cases will likely 
still need a struct device wrapped around the IOASID. I think the 
particular one I want to solve is actually the odd one out in that it 
doesn't really care, and could be made to work either way.

Thanks,
Robin.
