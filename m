You are right. Current VT-d supports only 2nd level.

No. PRI is not tied to 1st or 2nd level. Actually from device p.o.v, it's
just a protocol to trigger page fault, but the device doesn't care whether
the page fault is on 1st or 2nd level in the IOMMU side. The only
relevant part is that a PRI request can have PASID tagged or cleared.
When it's tagged with PASID, the IOMMU will locate the translation
table under the given PASID (either 1st or 2nd level is fine, according
to PASID entry setting). When no PASID is included, the IOMMU locates
the translation from default entry (e.g. PASID#0 or any PASID contained
in RID2PASID in VT-d).

Your knowledge happened to be correct in deprecated ECS mode. At
that time, there is only one 2nd level per context entry which doesn't
support page fault, and there is only one 1st level per PASID entry which
supports page fault. Then PRI could be indirectly connected to 1st level,
but this just changed with new scalable mode.

Another note is that the PRI capability only indicates that a device is
capable of handling page faults, but not that a device can tolerate
page fault for any of its DMA access. If the latter is fasle, using CPU 
page table for DPDK usage is still risky (and specific to device behavior)

using 1st level for userspace is different from supporting DMA page
fault in userspace. The former is purely about which structure to
keep the mapping. I think we may do the same thing for both bare
metal and guest (using 2nd level only for GPA when nested is enabled
on the IOMMU). But reusing CPU page table for userspace is more
tricky. :-)

Thanks
