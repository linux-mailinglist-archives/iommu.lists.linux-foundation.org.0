I am still a bit puzzled about how the blocking_domain should be used 
when it is extended to support ->set_dev_pasid.

If it's a blocking domain, the IOMMU driver knows that setting the
blocking domain to device pasid means detaching the existing one.

But if it's an identity domain, how could the IOMMU driver choose
between:

  - setting the input domain to the pasid on device; or,
  - detaching the existing domain.

I've ever thought about below solutions:

- Checking the domain types and dispatching them to different
   operations.
- Using different blocking domains for different types of domains.

But both look rough.

Agreed. There seems to be a long way to go. I am wondering if we could
decouple this refactoring from my new SVA API work? We can easily switch
.detach_dev_pasid to using blocking domain later.
