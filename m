Too many in what regard?  fd limits?  Something else?

It seems to be there are two different cases for PASID handling here.
One is where userspace explicitly creates each valid PASID and
attaches a separate pagetable for each (or handles each with
MAP/UNMAP).  In that case I wouldn't have expected there to be too
many fds.

Then there's the case where we register a whole PASID table, in which
case I think you only need the one FD.  We can treat that as creating
an 84-bit IOAS, whose pagetable format is (PASID table + a bunch of
pagetables for each PASID).

Ah... hrm, yes I can see that.

I'm still not seeing those.  I'm really not seeing any well-defined
meaning to devices being attached to the fd, but not to a particular
IOAS.

That makes sense.  Needs a different name to avoid Intel and PCI
specificness, but having a trivial "pagetable format" which just says
IOVA =3D=3D user address is nice idea.

Ok.

Right.  I think this gets nicer now that we're considering more
specific options at IOAS creation time, and different "types" of
IOAS.  We could add a "preregistration" IOAS type, which supports
MAP/UNMAP of user addresses, and allows *no* devices to be attached,
but does allow other IOAS types to be added as children.

Right.  With the possible exception that I can imagine a call for
several types which all support MAP/UNMAP, but have other different
characteristics.

Agreed.
