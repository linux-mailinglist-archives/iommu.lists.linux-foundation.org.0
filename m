Huh? Of the drivers indicated, the SCP driver is doing nothing but 
coherent allocations, and I'm not entirely sure what those ISP driver 
patches are supposed to be doing but I suspect it's probably just buffer 
allocation too. I don't see any actual streaming DMA anywhere :/

Can you clarify what's being copied, and where? I'm not all that 
familiar with the media APIs, but I thought it was all based around 
preallocated DMA buffers (the whole dedicated "videobuf" thing)? The few 
instances of actual streaming DMA I can see in drivers/media/ look to be 
mostly PCI drivers mapping private descriptors, whereas the MTK ISP 
appears to be entirely register-based.

No, just fix the dma_alloc_noncontiguous() fallback case to split the 
allocation into dma_max_mapping_size() chunks. *That* makes sense.

Thanks,
Robin.
