I don't really understand what you mean by that.

Uh.. I don't really know how mdevs are isolated from each other.  I
thought it was because the physical device providing the mdevs
effectively had an internal IOMMU (or at least DMA permissioning) to
isolate the mdevs, even though the physical device may not be fully
isolated.

In that case the virtual mdev is effectively in a singleton group,
which is different from the group of its parent device.

If the physical device had a bug which meant the mdevs *weren't*
properly isolated from each other, then those mdevs would share a
group, and you *would* care about it.  Depending on how the isolation
failed the mdevs might or might not also share a group with the parent
physical device.

The don't necessarily care about the IOMMU groups of the parent
physical hardware, but they have their own IOMMU groups as virtual
hardware devices.

I'm not really following what you're saying there.

If you have a multi-device group, and dpdk is using one device in it,
VFIO *does not* (and cannot) ensure that other devices in the group
are parked and inaccessible.  It ensures that they're parked at the
moment the group moves from kernel to userspace ownership, but it
can't prevent dpdk from accessing and unparking those devices via peer
to peer DMA.

That seems a bigger problem than "more tricky".  How would you propose
addressing this with your device-first model?
