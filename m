How does divide by 10 save a divide?

I think I understand what you're getting at. We'd need to have the
total running 'scale' and the incremental 'scale' for each loop
iteration. We could do that by using cmd.tlbi.scale to keep the
running total. So something like this (untested)?:

if (smmu->features & ARM_SMMU_FEAT_RANGE_INV) {
    unsigned long scale, num;

    /* Determine the power of 2 multiple number of pages */
    scale = __ffs(num_pages);
    cmd.tlbi.scale += scale;

    /* Determine how many chunks of 2^scale size we have */
    num = (num_pages >> scale) & CMDQ_TLBI_RANGE_NUM_MAX;
    cmd.tlbi.num = num - 1;

    /* range is num * 2^scale * pgsize */
    granule = num << (cmd.tlbi.scale + tg);

    /* Clear out the lower order bits for the next iteration */
    num_pages >>= 5 + scale;
}

That's actually worse by 1 add and probably a memory (re)load of
cmd.tlbi.scale AFAICT.
