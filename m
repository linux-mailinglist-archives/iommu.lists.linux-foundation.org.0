I thought that was usually the way UEFI systems worked, where the kernel
is updated independently of the device-tree? Either way, that should be
what we're aiming for, even if many platforms require the two to be tied
together.

Hmm. Recompiling seems like even more of a last resort to me!

How about:

  "Blocked transaction from unknown Stream ID x; boot with
   \"arm-smmu.disable_bypass=0\" to allow these transactions, although this
   may have security implications."
