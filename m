Yeah, so I mentally tend to think of the operations as just
"writeback" (which doesn't invalidate) and "flush" (which is a
writeback-invalidate).

Which explains my word-usage, but isn't great, because it's not
well-defined. And I'm not even consistent about it.

So in my model, (1) is the only case where there's actively dirty data
that needs to be written back. That's the "CPU wrote the data to
memory, and wants to transfer it to the device" case.

In (2) and (3), the only question is whether possibly clean cachelines
contain - or will contain - stale data.

And then exactly when you actually invalidate is up to you.

For example, in

 (2) The CPU now wants to see any state written by the device

you have multiple options. You could invalidate any stale cache lines.

Or you could say "We wrote them back and invalidated them in (1), so
we don't need to invalidate them now".

And in

 (3) The CPU looked at the data while it was in flight and is now done with it.

you can (again) decide to do nothing at all, BUT ONLY IF (2) chose
that "invalidate" option. Because if you made your (2) depend on that
"they were already invalidated", then (3) has to invalidate the CPU
caches so that a subsequent (2) will work right.

So these are all somewhat interconnected.

You can do just "writeback" in (1), but then you _have_ to do
"invalidate" in (2), and in that case you don't have to do anything at
all in (3).

Or maybe your CPU only has that "writeback-and-invalidate" operation,
so you decide that (2) should be a no-op, and (3) - which is
presumably less common than (2) - also does that writeback-invalidate
thing.

Or we can also say that (3) is not allowed at all - so the ath9k case
is actively wrong and we should warn about that case - but that again
constrains what you can do in (2) and now that previous optimization
is not valid.

And it's worth noting that if your CPU may do cache fills as a result
of speculative accesses (or just sufficiently out of order), then the
whole argument that "I invalidated those lines earlier, so I don't
need to invalidate them now" is just garbage.

Fun, isn't it?

Right, I think that "if the CPU dirties the cacheline while the device
has ownership, then the data is going to be undefined".

And btw, it does actually potentially happen for real - imagine a user
mmap'ing the IO buffer while IO is in flight. The kernel can't control
for that (well, we can make things read-only, and some uses do), but
then it's often a question of "you have to dirty that area and do the
IO again, because the last attempt sent out undefined data".

And note how this "undefined data" situation can happen even with
coherent IO, so this part isn't even about cache coherency - it's
literally about just about memory accesses being in some undefined
order.

So it *can* be valid to send inconsistent data, but that should be
considered the really odd case.

Yeah, and see above about how the CPU could even write (but honestly,
that isn't valid in the general case, it really requires that kind of
active "we can fix it up later" thing).

Again, see above. Losing the CPU write is really bad, because then you
can't even recover by re-doing the operation.

So yes, when looking at only the "single operation" case, it looks
like "lose one or the other". But in the bigger picture, one is more
important than the other.

Well, you get it back by just checking that the IO is done. Once the
IO is done, the CPU owns the area again.

And the "IO is done" is often some entirely independent status in some
entirely different place.

But it *could* be something that requires a CPU read from that DMA
area. But it's a CPU _read_, so you don't need write ownership for
that.

That's why there is only one DMA_TO_DEVICE, and there are two
DMA_FROM_DEVICE cases.

The DMA_TO_DEVICE cannot have a "let me write in the middle" situation.

But the DMA_FROM_DEVICE has that "let me read in the middle, and
decide if it's done or not", so you can have a looping read, and
that's where (3) comes in.

You can't have a looping write for one operation (but you can
obviously have several independent write operations - that's what the
whole "are you done" is all about)

See above. Both cases have "the device is done with this", but they
are fundamentally different situations.

Yeah, the solution may well be "grep for it, and pick the right
direction once the docs are clear".
