The attribute should be called something like "location" or something
like that (naming is hard), as you don't always know if something is
external or not (it could be internal, it could be unknown, it could be
internal to an external device that you trust (think PCI drawers for
"super" computers that are hot pluggable but yet really part of the
internal bus).

"trust" has no direct relation to the location, except in a policy of
what you wish to do with that device, so as long as you keep them
separate that way, I am fine with it.
