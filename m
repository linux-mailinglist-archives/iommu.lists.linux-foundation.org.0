AFAIK there is no erratum documented internally for this behaviour and 
this
exists from MSM8996 SoC time and errata usually don't survive this long
across generation of SoCs and there is no point for us in disguising it.

Is it OK if we clearly mention it as the "design limitation" or some 
other
term which we can agree upon along with the description which Rob and 
Jordan
provided for setting HUPCF in the driver when we add the set_hupcf 
callback?

Thanks,
Sai
