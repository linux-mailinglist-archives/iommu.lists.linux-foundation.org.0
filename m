Yes.  My proposed model for a unified interface would be that when you
create a new container/IOASID, *no* IOVAs are valid.  Before you can
map anything you would have to create a window with specified base,
size, pagesize (probably some flags for extension, too).  That could
fail if the backend IOMMU can't handle that IOVA range, it could be a
backend no-op if the requested window lies within a fixed IOVA range
the backend supports, or it could actually reprogram the back end for
the new window (such as for POWER TCEs).  Regardless of the hardware,
attempts to map outside the created window(s) would be rejected by
software.

I expect we'd need some kind of query operation to expose limitations
on the number of windows, addresses for them, available pagesizes etc.

Huh... I never thought of it that way, but yeah, that sounds like it
could work.  More elegantly than the current system in fact.

I think it should be doable.  We'd basically need to give KVM a handle
on the parent AS, and the child AS, and the guest side handle (what
PAPR calls a "Logical IO Bus Number" - liobn).  KVM would then
translate H_PUT_TCE etc. hypercalls on that liobn into calls into the
IOMMU subsystem to map bits of the parent AS into the child.  We'd
probably have to have some requirements that either parent AS is
identity-mapped to a subset of the userspace AS (effectively what we
have now) or that parent AS is the same as guest physical address.
Not sure which would work better.

I'm hoping we can even avoid that, usually.  With the explicitly
created windows model I propose above, it should be able to: qemu will
create the windows according to the IOVA windows the guest platform
expects to see and they either will or won't work on the host platform
IOMMU.  If they do, generic maps/unmaps should be sufficient.  If they
don't well, the host IOMMU simply cannot emulate the vIOMMU so you're
out of luck anyway.
