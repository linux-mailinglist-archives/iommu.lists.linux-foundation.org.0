Hey Will,
  Sorry to dredge up this old thread. I've been off busy with other
things and didn't get around to trying to rework this until now.

Unfortunately I'm still having some trouble coming up with a better
solution. Initially I figured I'd rework the qcom_scm driver to, so
that we have the various qcom_scm_* as inline functions, which call
out to function pointers that the qcom_scm driver would register when
the module loaded (Oof, and unfortunately there are a *ton* qcom_scm_*
functions so its a bunch of churn).

The trouble I realized with that approach is that if the ARM_SMMU code
is built in, then it may try to use the qcom_scm code before the
module loads and sets those function pointers. So while it would build
ok, the issue would be when the arm_smmu_device_reset() is done by
done on arm_smmu_device_probe(), it wouldn't actually call the right
code.  There isn't a really good way to deal with the module loading
at some random time after arm_smmu_device_probe() completes.

This is the benefit of the module symbol dependency tracking: If the
arm_smmu.ko calls symbols in qcom_scm.ko then qcom_scm.ko has to load
first.
But if arm_smmu is built in, I haven't found a clear mechanism to
force qcom_scm to load before we probe, if it's configured as a
module.

I also looked into the idea of reworking the arm-smmu-impl code to be
modular instead, and while it does provide a similar method of using
function pointers to minimize the amount of symbols the arm-smmu code
needs to know about, the initialization call path is
arm_smmu_device_probe -> arm_smmu_impl_init -> qcom_smmu_impl_init. So
it doesn't really allow for dynamic registration of implementation
modules at runtime.

So I'm sort of stewing on maybe trying to rework the directionality,
so the arm-smmu-qcom.o code probes and calls arm_smmu_impl_init and
that is what initializes the arm_smmu_device_probe logic?

Alternatively, I'm considering trying to switch the module dependency
annotation so that the CONFIG_QCOM_SCM modularity depends on ARM_SMMU
being a module. But that is sort of putting the restriction on the
callee instead of the caller (sort of flipping the meaning of the
depends), which feels prone to later trouble (and with multiple users
of CONFIG_QCOM_SCM needing similar treatment, it would make it
difficult to discover the right combination of configs needed to allow
it to be a module).

Anyway, I wanted to reach out to see if you had any further ideas
here. Sorry for letting such a large time gap pass!

thanks
-john
