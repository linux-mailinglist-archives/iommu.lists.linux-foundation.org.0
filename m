For this patch, yes.

The existing vfio implementation allows a kernel driver to bind with a
PCI bridge while its downstream devices are assigned to the user space
though there lacks ACS-like isolation in bridge.

drivers/vfio/vfio.c:
  540 static bool vfio_dev_driver_allowed(struct device *dev,
  541                                     struct device_driver *drv)
  542 {
  543         if (dev_is_pci(dev)) {
  544                 struct pci_dev *pdev = to_pci_dev(dev);
  545
  546                 if (pdev->hdr_type != PCI_HEADER_TYPE_NORMAL)
  547                         return true;
  548         }

We are moving the group viability check to IOMMU core, and trying to
make it compatible with the current vfio policy. We saw three types of
bridges:

#1) PCIe/PCI-to-PCI bridges
     These bridges are configured in the PCI framework, there's no
     dedicated driver for such devices.

#2) Generic PCIe switch downstream port
     The port driver doesn't map and access any MMIO in the PCI BAR.
     The iommu group is viable to user even this driver is bound.

#3) Hot Plug Controller
     The controller driver maps and access the device MMIO. The iommu
     group is not viable to user with this driver bound to its device.

Sure.

When a device driver is about to bind with a device, the driver core
will claim the kernel DMA ownership automatically for the driver.

This implies that
- if success, the kernel driver is controlling the device for DMA. Any
   devices sitting in the same iommu group shouldn't be assigned to user.
- if failure, some devices sitting in the same iommu group have already
   been assigned to user space. The driver binding process should abort.

But there are some exceptions where suppress_auto_claim_dma_owner comes
to play.

#1) vfio-like drivers which will assign the devices to user space after
     driver binding;
#2) (compatible with exiting vfio policy) some drivers are allowed to be
     bound with a device while its siblings in the iommu group are
     assigned to user space. Typically, these drivers include
     - pci_stub driver
     - pci bridge drivers

For above drivers, we use driver.suppress_auto_claim_dma_owner as a hint
to tell the driver core to ignore the kernel dma ownership claiming.

As I explained above.

I just used it as an example to show that allowing any driver to be
bound to a PCI bridge device in a USER-viable iommu group is too loose.

Sure. Set driver.suppress_auto_claim_dma_owner = true.

Sure.

Before this series, bridge drivers are always allowed to be bound with
PCI/PCIe bridge which is sitting in an iommu group assigned to user
space. After this, only those drivers which have
suppress_auto_claim_dma_owner set could be done so. Otherwise, the
driver binding or group user assignment will fail.

The criteria of what kind of drivers could have this hint set is "driver
doesn't map and access the MMIO define in the PCI BARs".
