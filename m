Rob is right about HUPCF. Due to the parallel nature of the command processor
there is always a very good chance that a CP access is somewhere in the bus so
any pagefault is usually a death sentence. The GPU context bank would always
want HUPCF set to 1.

Downstream also uses CFCFG for stall-on-fault debug case. You wouldn't want
this on all the time in production since bringing down the world for every user
pagefault is less than desirable so it needs to be modified in run-time (or at
the very least kernel command line selectable).

Jordan

PS: Interestingly, the GMU does not want HUPCF set to 1 because it wants to
crash immediately on all invalid accesses so ideally these combination of bits
would be configurable on a per-context basis.
