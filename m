I suppose it could if anyone cared enough to make the effort - probably 
a case of resolving specific MSI domains for every device in the group, 
and potentially having to deal with hotplug later as well. 
Realistically, though, I wouldn't expect systems to have mixed 
capabilities in that regard (i.e. where the check would return false 
even though *some* domains support remapping), so there doesn't seem to 
be any pressing need to relax it.

Cheers,
Robin.
