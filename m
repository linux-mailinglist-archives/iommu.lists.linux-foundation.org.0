Perhaps we could just leave that sentence as "Otherwise the NULL domain 
represents platform-specific behaviour."

Good point - in particular I think the "DMA is always translated" part 
would be more accurately said as "DMA is always managed". When we're 
reattaching back to the default domain here, and it happens to be an 
identity domain, then DMA *may* be untranslated, but in a manner that 
we've knowingly chosen. The key point is that if the driver supports 
core domains, then it should never have any in-between state that allows 
access to anything *other* than the current domain or the new domain.

Thanks,
Robin.
