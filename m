Well, strictly it uses the ops as a "negative" heuristic that the 
domains are not definitely incompatible, and only then consolidates 
domains if cross-attaching actually succeeds. So I don't think it's 
really so bad.

Previous comment notwithstanding, much as I do tend to prefer "just try 
the operation and see what happens" APIs, that might be more reliable in 
the long run than trying to encode specific "sorry, you'll need to 
allocate a separate domain for this device" vs. "this should have worked 
but something went wrong" semantics in the return value from attach.

In the ideal case though, the SVA domains are only there to logically 
bridge between an existing process pagetable and IOMMU instances at the 
API level, right? Surely if we're shadowing physical pagetables for SVA 
we've basically already lost the performance game?
