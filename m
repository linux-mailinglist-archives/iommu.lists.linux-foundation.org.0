Strictly they're not ignored, you just won't be getting past the point 
where they're not entirely not ignored. It'll appear to work because 
arm_smmu_rmr_install_bypass_smr() just bypasses the whole stream until 
the actual device turns up to join up to the StreamID and the "real" 
processing of RMRs happens via iommu_create_device_direct_mappings() - 
if there's no actual HDLCD device described in the DSDT, that will never 
happen, and even if there is, chances are that things will currently 
happen in the wrong order such we'd end up waiting to replay 
iommu_probe_device() from acpi_iommu_configure_id() once a driver binds, 
and *that* definitely can't happen without teaching the HDLCD driver 
about ACPI.

In general we can't second-guess firmware. Even a zero-length RMR should 
have ample opportunity to blow up outside this one corner case where 
Linux never gets to associate the StreamID with a corresponding device.

Robin.
