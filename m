I'm not an expert in the Intel or AMD code, so I can only speak with 
confidence about what we do in io-pgtable-arm, but the main reason for 
not freeing pagetables is that it's simply not worth the bother of 
trying to work out whether a whole sub-tree is empty. Not to mention 
whether it's *still* empty by the time that we may have figured out that 
it was.

There are only 3 instances where we'll free a table while the domain is 
live. The first is the one legitimate race condition, where two map 
requests targeting relatively nearby PTEs both go to fill in an 
intermediate level of table; whoever loses that race frees the table 
they allocated, but it was never visible to anyone else so that's 
definitely fine. The second is if we're mapping a block entry, and find 
that there's already a table entry there, wherein we assume the table 
must be empty, clear the entry, invalidate any walk caches, install the 
block entry, then free the orphaned table; since we're mapping the 
entire IOVA range covered by that table, there should be no other 
operations on that IOVA range attempting to walk the table at the same 
time, so it's fine. The third is effectively the inverse, if we get a 
block-sized unmap but find a table entry rather than a block at that 
point (on the assumption that it's de-facto allowed for a single unmap 
to cover multiple adjacent mappings as long as it does so exactly); 
similarly we assume that the table must be full, and no other operations 
should be racing because we're unmapping its whole IOVA range, so we 
remove the table entry, invalidate, and free as before.

Again for efficiency reasons we don't attempt to validate those 
assumptions by inspecting the freed tables, so odd behaviour can fall 
out if the caller *does* do something bogus. For example if two calls 
race to map a block and a page in the same (unmapped) region, the block 
mapping will always succeed (and be what ends up in the final pagetable 
state), but the page mapping may or may not report failure depending on 
the exact timing.

Although we don't have debug dumping for io-pgtable-arm, it's good to be 
thinking about this, since it's made me realise that dirty-tracking 
sweeps per that proposal might pose a similar kind of concern, so we 
might still need to harden these corners for the sake of that. Which 
also reminds me that somewhere I have some half-finished patches making 
io-pgtable-arm use the iommu_iotlb_gather freelist, so maybe I'll tackle 
both concerns at once (perhaps we might even be able to RCU-ify the 
freelist generically? I'll see how it goes when I get there).

Cheers,
Robin.
