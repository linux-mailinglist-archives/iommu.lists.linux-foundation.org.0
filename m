We can also remove iommu_attach_group() in VFIO because it is
essentially equivalent to

	iommu_group_for_each_dev(group, iommu_attach_device(dev))

There is also a contract that after the USER ownership is claimed the
device could be accessed by userspace through the MMIO registers. So,
a device could be accessible by userspace before a user-space I/O
address is attached.

I hope we can drop all group variant APIs as we already have the per-
device interfaces, just iterate all device in the group and call the
device API.

iommu_device_set_dma_owner() will eventually call
iommu_group_set_dma_owner(). I didn't get why
iommu_group_set_dma_owner() is special and need to keep.

Perhaps I missed anything. I have a simpler idea. We only need to have
below interfaces:

	iommu_device_set_dma_owner(dev, owner);
	iommu_device_release_dma_owner(dev, owner);
	iommu_attach_device(domain, dev, owner);
	iommu_detach_device(domain, dev);

All existing drivers calling iommu_attach_device() remain unchanged
since we already have singleton group enforcement. We only need to add
a default owner type.

For multiple-device group, like drm/tegra, the drivers should claim the
PRIVATE_DOMAIN ownership and call iommu_attach_device(domain, dev,
PRIVATE_DOMAIN) explicitly.

The new iommu_attach_device(domain, dev, owner) is a mix of the existing
iommu_attach_device() and the new iommu_attach_device_shared(). That
means,
	if (group_is_singleton(group))
		__iommu_atttach_device(domain, dev)
	else
		__iommu_attach_device_shared(domain, dev, owner)

The group variant interfaces will be deprecated and replace with the
device ones.

Sorry if I missed anything.
