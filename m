Yes, we discussed it [1] before. So I'd like to re-introduce
SET_STATUS messages so that the userspace can fail feature negotiation
during setting FEATURES_OK status bit.

Agreed. I will use VDUSE_DEV_GET_CONFIG in the next version. And to
handle the message failure, I'm going to add a return value to
virtio_config_ops.get() and virtio_cread_* API so that the error can
be propagated to the virtio device driver. Then the virtio-blk device
driver can be modified to handle that.

Jason and Stefan, what do you think of this way?

I see.
