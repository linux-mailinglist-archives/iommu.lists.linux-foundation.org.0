Thanks for providing that link. However clone3 doesn't include a version
field to do "version as size" lookup. Instead, as you said, it includes a
size parameter which sounds like the option 3 (argsz) listed below.

I feel argsz+flags approach can perfectly meet above requirement. The
userspace set the size and flags for whatever capabilities it uses, and
VFIO simply copies the parameters by size and pass to IOMMU for
further sanity check. Of course the assumption is that we do provide
an interface for userspace to enumerate all supported capabilities.

Is there anything that I overlooked here? I suppose there might be
some difficulties that block you from going the argsz way...

Thanks
