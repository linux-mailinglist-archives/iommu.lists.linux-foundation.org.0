Ack to that, there are certainly further improvements to consider once 
we've got known-working code into a released kernel, but let's not get 
ahead of ourselves just now.

(I'm pretty sure we could get away with a single blocking domain per 
IOMMU instance, rather than per group, but I deliberately saved that one 
for later - right now one per group to match default domains is simpler 
to reason about and less churny in the context of the current ownership 
patches)

Cheers,
Robin.
