That would be possible. The only difference is that I need to
program ID 0 of the first DART and ID 1 of the second one. Both
of these IDs are only connected to the same USB controller.

Yes, the easier driver implementation was my reason to favour this option.

Sounds good. I'll read those drivers and give it a try for v2.
