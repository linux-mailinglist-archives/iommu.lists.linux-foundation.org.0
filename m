For sure, but it is good practice to limit that.

I had to fix something like this recently, so know about it... another 
potential problem is use-after-frees, where your device managed memory 
is freed at removal but still registered somewhere.

It may be good to add it to older stable kernels also, pre c07b6426df92.

I'll have a play on my laptop and see how well that works if
