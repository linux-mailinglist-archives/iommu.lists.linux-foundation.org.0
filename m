I believe it can resolve the performance problem for the SVA
applications if we disable vm.compact_unevcitable_allowed and
NUMA_BALANCE, and use mlock().

The problem is that it is insensible to ask users to disable
unevictable_allowed or numa balancing of the whole system
only because there is one SVA application in the system.

SVA, for itself, is a mechanism to let cpu and devices share same
address space. In a typical server system, there are many processes,
the better way would be only changing the behavior of the specific
process rather than changing the whole system. It is hard to ask
users to do that only because there is a SVA monster.
Plus, this might negatively affect those applications not using SVA.

sensible. Actually pin is exactly the way to disable migration for specific
pages AKA. disabling "vm.compact_unevictable_allowed" on those pages.

It is hard to differentiate what pages should not be migrated. Only apps
know that as even SVA applications can allocate many non-IO pages which
should be able to move.
