Brice,

Given hwloc is probably the most demanding user of topology information
currently...

How useful would this info be for hwloc and hwloc users?
Sort of feels like it might be useful in some cases.

The very brief description of what we have here is exposing the numa node
of an IOMMU.  The discussion also diverted into whether it just makes sense
to expose this for all platform devices or even do it at the device level.
