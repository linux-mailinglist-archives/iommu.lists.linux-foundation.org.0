I had looked at it a bit to see if I could easily implement that, but
the direct mapping support in the IOMMU subsystem currently only
supports either reservations or identity mappings, so arbitrary mappings
would either have to be added to that code, or it would have to take a
different code path that basically goes through the same steps, except
that it uses different physical and I/O virtual addresses.

The easiest, I think, would be for struct iommu_resv_region to be
extended with a pair of start/length fields for the I/O virtual address
and then the rest of the code should mostly work. This shouldn't even be
very invasive, maybe just adding a version of iommu_alloc_resv_region()
that takes the I/O virtual addresses as additional parameters.

Come to think of it, the current code could probably be improved a bit
by checking if the addresses in the reg and iommu-addresses properties
match. Currently the code just ignores the reserved memory region's
"reg" property, so one could technically set up a mapping that points to
physical memory that the device doesn't "own".
