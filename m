Well, I suppose we'd have something for DT and something for ACPI and we'd
try to make them look similar enough that we don't need lots of divergent
code in the kernel. The RMRR-like description would describe that, for a
particular device, a specific virt:phys mapping needs to exist in the
small window between initialising the SMMU and re-initialising the device
(GPU).

I would prefer this to be framebuffer-specific, since we're already in
flagrant violation of the arm64 boot requirements wrt ongoing DMA and making
this too general could lead to all sorts of brain damage. That would
probably also allow us to limit the flexibility, by mandating things like
alignment and memory attributes.

Having said that, I just realised I'm still a bit confused about the
problem: why does the bootloader require SMMU translation for the GPU at
all? If we could limit this whole thing to be identity-mapped/bypassed,
then all we need is a per-device flag in the firmware to indicate that the
SMMU should be initialised to allow passthrough for transactions originating
from that device.

That's not going to fly.

Forcing Linux to infer the state of the system by effectively parsing the
hardware configuration directly is fragile, error-prone and may not even be
possible in the general case. Worse, if this goes wrong, the symptoms are
very likely to be undiagnosable memory corruption, which is pretty awful in
my opinion.

Not only would you need separate parsing code for every IOMMU out there,
but you'd also need to make Linux aware of device aspects that it otherwise
doesn't care about, just in case the firmware decided to use them.
Furthermore, running an older kernel on newer hardware (which may have some
extensions), could cause the parsing to silently ignore parts of the device
that indicate memory regions which are in use. On top of that, there made be
device-global state that we are unable to reconfigure and that affect
devices other than the ones in question.

So no, I'm very much against this approach and the solution absolutely needs
to come in the form of a more abstract description from firmware.

It's precisely this sort of fragility that makes me nervous about this whole
approach.
