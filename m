It's unclear whether the following is a list of all values the user 
could both read and write (which it isn't).

Why "dma", and not "DMA" (which is what we would read for DMA type)?

Isn't this the same as reset value, which we could read and remember?

(And the kernel could reject when we attempt to change to a disallowed 
type).

I think that this goes without saying.
