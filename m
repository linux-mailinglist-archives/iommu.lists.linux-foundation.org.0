As far as I'm aware that should only be possible if the subdevice has a 
distinct physical requester ID from the real device, which given the 
nomenclature I assume is not the case.

(well, technically you *can* start routing different logical streams 
from a single requester ID to multiple domains if you have PASIDs, but 
that's a whole other ball game)
