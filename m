We have seen couple of stability issues around this.
Below is one such example:

kernel BUG at kernel/msm-4.19/drivers/iommu/iova.c:904!
iova_magazine_free_pfns
iova_rcache_insert
free_iova_fast
__iommu_unmap_page
iommu_dma_unmap_page


It turned out an iova pfn 0 got into iova_rcache. One possibility I see 
is
where client unmap with invalid dma_addr. The unmap call will fail and 
warn on
and still try to free iova. This will cause invalid pfn to be inserted 
into
rcache. As and when the magazine with invalid pfn will be freed
private_find_iova() will return NULL for invalid iova and meet bug 
condition.

I agree, we shouldn't be freeing the partial iova. Instead just making
sure if unmap was successful should be sufficient before freeing iova. 
So change
can instead be something like this:

-	iommu_dma_free_iova(cookie, dma_addr, size);
+	if (unmapped)
+		iommu_dma_free_iova(cookie, dma_addr, size);

This condition would arise only if driver calling dma_unmap/free_* with 
0
iova_pfn. This will be flagged with a warning during unmap but will 
trigger
panic later on while doing unrelated dma_map/unmap_*. If unmapped has 
already
failed for invalid iova, there is no reason we should consider this as 
valid
iova and free. This part should be fixed.

Added now.
