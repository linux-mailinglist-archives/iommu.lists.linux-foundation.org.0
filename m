Can you explain that further, or spit-ball what you think this /dev/sva
interface looks like and how a user might interact between vfio and
this new interface?  The interface proposed here definitely does not
seem orthogonal to the vfio IOMMU interface, ie. selecting a specific
IOMMU domain mode during vfio setup, allocating pasids and associating
them with page tables for that two-stage IOMMU setup, performing cache
invalidations based on page table updates, etc.  How does it make more
sense for a vIOMMU to setup some aspects of the IOMMU through vfio and
others through a TBD interface?

The IOMMU needs to allocate PASIDs, so in that sense it enforces a
quota via the architectural limits, but is the IOMMU layer going to
distinguish in-kernel versus user limits?  A cgroup limit seems like a
good idea, but that's not really at the IOMMU layer either and I don't
see that a /dev/sva and vfio interface couldn't both support a cgroup
type quota.

And it's not clear that they'll have compatible requirements.  A
userspace idxd driver might have limited needs versus a vIOMMU backend.
Does a single quota model adequately support both or are we back to the
differences between access to a device and ownership of a device?
Maybe a single pasid per user makes sense in the former.  If we could
bring this discussion to some sort of more concrete proposal it might
be easier to weigh the choices.

APIs confined to the ownership model that vfio already enforces might
absolutely present a more limited attack surface than some new
interface intended to provide universal sva resource access.  We don't
know until we see it.  The real argument would be whether we have a
more hardened interface due to more review from more users.

Doesn't the PASID model essentially just augment the requester ID IOMMU
model so as to manage the IOVAs for a subdevice of a RID?  The vfio
model builds on a user's access to a vfio group to entitle them to
allocate IOMMU resources, or in this case PASIDs.  What elevates a user
to be able to allocate such resources in this new proposal?  Do they
need a device at all?  It's not clear to me why RID based IOMMU
management fits within vfio's scope, but PASID based does not.  Seems
like that would chip away at aux domains in general.  Thanks,

Alex
