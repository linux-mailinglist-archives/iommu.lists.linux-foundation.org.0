A minor question: If someone wrote error data that don't conform to the
dtbinding, the error result is expected. He should fix that problem,
right? If we could avoid abort and show error message at the beginning,
it's better of course.

Thanks very much for your time to check here. All the issues are
introduced by the values from dts are untrusted. The detail platform
informations are replied below.

OK. Add a "else" to show it is a block with the "if" above?

        if (larb_nr < 0)
             return larb_nr;
        else if (larb_nr == 0 || larb_nr > MTK_LARB_NR_MAX)
             return -EINVAL;

We could find the "mediatek,smi" with any available larb. Of course it
should not be a disabled one. The code using the last larb is for
reusing the variable "larbnode".

A new variable is ok.

Yes. It may have gaps. the commit message of this patch may be helpful.

SMI")

This case did don't meet my expectation. OK, then we add a checking?
like:

   if (data->larb_imu[i].dev) {
         dev_err(dev, "the larb %d exist.", i);
         return -EEXIST;
   }

It should be [0, MTK_LARB_NR_MAX).

We could use any available larb node to find mediatek,smi.

Their "mediatek,smi" node must be the same. OK, In this case, they are
possible different. We should add a checking: return -EINVAL if they
are not same.

Appreciate for help enhance the safe here. I will test it.
