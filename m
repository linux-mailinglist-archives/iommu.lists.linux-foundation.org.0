Do you really need this flag, or is it effectively just mirroring 
"!can_insert" - in theory if there wasn't enough memory to allocate a 
new magazine, then freeing some more IOVAs wouldn't necessarily be a bad 
thing to do anyway.

Other than that, I think this looks reasonable. Every time I look at 
__iova_rcache_insert() I'm convinced there must be a way to restructure 
it to be more streamlined overall, but I can never quite see exactly how...

Thanks,
Robin.
