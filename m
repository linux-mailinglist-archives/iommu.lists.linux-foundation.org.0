Hi Yi,

Thanks for the comments.

No worry.

IOVA over first level is a sub-feature of scalable mode. Currently,
scalable mode is default off and we won't switch it on until all
features are done.

We merged first level and second level, hence the domain->agaw should be
selected for both. The only shortcoming of this is that it doesn't
support a 3-only second level in scalable mode. But I don't think we
have any chances to see such hardware.

Yes. Good catch! We should manipulate the page table entry according to
this requirement.
