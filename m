By IMS patches, I meant your IMS driver patch that was updated (as it 
was untested, it had some compile

errors and we removed the IMS_QUEUE parts) :

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/160021246221.67751.16280230469654363209.stgit@djiang5-desk3.ch.intel.com/

and some iommu related changes required by IMS.

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/160021246905.67751.1674517279122764758.stgit@djiang5-desk3.ch.intel.com/

The whole patchset can be found here:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/f4a085f1-f6de-2539-12fe-c7308d243a4a@intel.com/

It would be great if you could review the IMS patches :)

I have tested these patches and it works fine (I had to add a couple of 
EXPORT_SYMBOLS).

We were hoping to get IMS in the 5.10 merge window :)

In our patch series, we have removed the IMS_QUEUE stuff and retained 
only the IMS_ARRAY parts

as that was sufficient for us.
