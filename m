Yes I agree that logically this makes more sense. I was kind of aiming
in the same direction as Alex i.e. it's a conscious decision to do it
right and we need to know where this may lead to differences and how to
handle them.

This was the issue reported in the following BZ.

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=209025

I stumbled over the same problem on my x86 box and also on s390. I
don't remember exactly what limit this ran into but I suspect it had
something to do with the libvirt resource limits Alex mentioned.
Meaning io_uring had an accounting bug and then vfio / QEMU couldn't
pin memory. I think that libvirt limit is set to allow pinning all of
guest memory plus a bit so the io_uring misaccounting easily tipped it
over.
