Can you elaborate the difficulty in VFIO? if, as Christoph Hellwig
pointed out, version number is already avoided everywhere, it is 
interesting to know whether this work becomes a real exception
or just requires a different mindset.

btw the most relevant discussion which I can find out now is here:
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/2/3/1126

It mentioned 3 options for handling extension:
--
1. Disallow adding new members to each structure other than reuse
padding bits or adding union members at the end.
2. Allow extension of the structures beyond union, but union size has
to be fixed with reserved spaces
3. Adopt VFIO argsz scheme, I don't think we need version for each
struct anymore. argsz implies the version that user is using assuming
UAPI data is extension only.
--

the first two are both version-based. Looks most guys agreed with 
option-1 (in this v2), but Alex didn't give his opinion at the moment. 
The last response from him was the raise of option-3 using argsz to 
avoid version. So, we also need hear from him. Alex?

Thanks
Kevin
