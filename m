Sure, it's clear that that's the direction in which this is headed, and 
as I say I'm quite excited about that. However there are a couple of 
points I think are really worth considering:

Where it's just about which operations are valid for which domains, it's 
even simpler for the core interface wrappers to validate the domain 
type, rather than forcing drivers to implement multiple ops structures 
purely for the sake of having different callbacks populated. We already 
have this in places, e.g. where iommu_map() checks for 
__IOMMU_DOMAIN_PAGING.

Paging domains are also effectively the baseline level of IOMMU API 
functionality. All drivers support them, and for the majority of drivers 
it's all they will ever support. Those drivers really don't benefit from 
any of the churn and boilerplate in this patch as-is, and it's so easy 
to compromise with a couple of lines of core code to handle the common 
case by default when the driver *isn't* one of the handful which ever 
actually cares to install their own per-domain ops. Consider how much 
cleaner this patch would look if the typical driver diff could be 
something completely minimal like this:

And of course I have to shy away from calling it default_domain_ops, 
since although it's logically default ops for domains, it is not 
specifically ops for default domains, sigh... :)

Cheers,
Robin.
