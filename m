I've got it from the Robin comment. Exactly that part seems very much
confusing to me, because what you say doesn't cohere with the passed
address type. If the passed address belongs to the MMIO space and is a
part of the CPU physical address space, then it is supposed to be
visible by the CPU as is (see the very first diagram in [1]). So the
mapping performed in the dma_map_resource() and dma_map_sg() methods
is supposed to match. Otherwise the spaces you are talking about are
different and as such need to be described by different types. Since
what you are talking about more seem like a DMA address space, then the
dma_map_resource() address needs to have the dma_addr_t type instead
of the phys_addr_t.

BTW here is a brightest example of a system, which contradicts the
MMIO-specific mapping semantics you are talking about (it actually
matches to what we've got except some interconnect implementation
peculiarities):

              +-----+
              | DDR |
              +--+--+
                 |
  +-----+ +------+-------+ +---------+
  | CPU +-+ Interconnect +-+ DEVs... |
  +-----+ +-----^-+------+ +---------+
     dma-ranges-| |-ranges
              +-+-v-+
              | PCI |
              +-----+

See, if I get to map a virtual memory address to be accessible by any
PCIe peripheral device, then the dma_map_sg/dma_map_page/etc
procedures will take the PCIe host controller dma-ranges into account.
It will work as expected and the PCIe devices will see the memory what
I specified. But if I get to pass the physical address of the same
page or a physical address of some device of the DEVs space to the
dma_map_resource(), then the PCIe dma-ranges won't be taken into
account, and the result mapping will be incorrect. That's why the
current dma_map_resource() implementation seems very confusing to me.
As I see it phys_addr_t is the type of the Interconnect address space,
meanwhile dma_addr_t describes the PCIe, DEVs address spaces.

Based on what I said here and in my previous email could you explain
what do I get wrong?
