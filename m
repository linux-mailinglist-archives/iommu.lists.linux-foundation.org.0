That makes sense about the serialisation.

I'm just concerned with the scenario when the queue is heavily 
contented; here we may be gathering multiple batches of commands, and 
owners and non-owners a. may delay each other in writing the commands b. 
also pend the final CMD_SYNC consumption, which is for all gathered 
commands, and not just the commands which a particular CPU is interested in.

Limited initial testing shows that it makes little difference...

To me, the biggest improvement is batching of the commands, and it may 
not make much difference either way in how we deal with submitting them 
to the queue.

Cheers,
John
