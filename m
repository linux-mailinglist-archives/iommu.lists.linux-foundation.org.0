IIUC this is another extension that's not yet frozen or implemented in 
hardware?  Is this one compatible with what's in the c906, or is it 
doing things its own way?

Can you guys please make up your minds about how this is going to be 
supported at the ISA level?  I get a different answer every day here: 
sometimes it's that these systems are not compliant, sometimes that 
Linux is the compliance suite, sometimes that we're doing an ISA 
extension, and sometimes that we're doing the SBI stuff.

I don't really care all that much about what the decision is, but it's 
impossible to move forward without some semblance of a plan.
