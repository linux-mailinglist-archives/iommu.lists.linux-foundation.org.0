Yeah, I'm not sure.  I think it probably doesn't for the "main path"
of the API, though we might want to expose that for debugging and some
edge cases.

We *should* however be exposing the address type for each IOAS, since
that affects how your MAP operations will work, as well as what
endpoints are compatible with the IOAS.

So.. first, is that really true across the board?  I expect it's true
of high end server hardware, but for consumer level and embedded
hardware as well?  Then there's virtual hardware - I could point to
several things still routinely using emulated PCIe to PCI bridges in
qemu.

Second, we can't just ignore older hardware.

Well, kind of, yeah, because I still think the concept has value.
Part of the trouble is that "device" is pretty ambiguous.  "Device" in
the sense of PCI address for register interface may not be the same as
"device" in terms of DMA RID may not be the same as as "device" in
terms of Linux struct device=20


terms of PCI register interface is not the same as "device"
in terms of RID / DMA identifiability is not the same "device" in
terms of what.

Which I think is confusing, and in any case doesn't cover the case of
one "device" with multiple endpoints.
