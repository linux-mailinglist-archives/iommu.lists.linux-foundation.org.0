That's one possible solution, but for that to work, all drivers with
optional suppliers would need to be changed to take advantage of this
callback to work correctly when the optional suppliers become
available. We could add this callback, but it would be a long time
before the callback handles all/most cases of optional suppliers.

One of the goals of fw_devlink is so that people can stop having to
play initcall chicken where they try to tune their initcall levels wrt
to the chain of suppliers to avoid probe failures or minimize deferred
probed. Technically with deferred probes and proper error handling,
people shouldn't have to play initcall chicken, but we still have a
lot of those. Adding this callback is just going to make writing
drivers even harder. And there are tons of drivers that can't do
proper clean up and some drivers can't even be unbound once they are
bound.

Also, if I'm not mistaken (I could be), stuff like pinctrl is setup
before we even get to driver->probe(). So when the pinctrl supplier
becomes available, the driver would need to unbind fully and rebind.
What if there's a current user of the device?

The timeout is defining how long after the most recent module load
that we give up waiting for more modules to be loaded. On a Pixel 6
with serial console output, the timeout of 5 seconds would work
because the worst case gap between two module loads is ~2.8 seconds
(so 5 seconds for some margin). The default is this high to
accommodate slow storage devices where mounting all the filesystems
can take time (think HDD or network FS). The default is configured for
correctness so that we can maximize functionality across systems, but
people can optimize for the specific case.

Having said all that, I empathize with your annoyance at the delay.
Open to ideas of making this better without making the default
functionality worse.
