this series does not use any PASID so it fits quite nicely into the VFIO
framework I think. Besides cache invalidation that takes the struct
device, other operations (MSI binding and PASID table passing operate on
the iommu domain). Also we use the VFIO memory region and
interrupt/eventfd registration mechanism to return faults.
