The default PBMT & c908 PBMT are similar, only BIT definitions are
different. I propose to support default PBMT first and give the back
door to modify the PBMT definition during boot.
The "protection_map[] = (__P000, __P001 ..__S000, __S001)" in
mm/mmap.c has been modified by arch/mips, arm, sparc, x86, so I think
it's proper solution direction.

The reset problem is how to passing custom PBMT at the very early boot
stage. Now I'm trying to use the DTS parsing instead of boot param hdr
which Anup objected to.
