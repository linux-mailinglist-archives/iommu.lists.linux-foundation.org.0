Humm... I could search the arhives, but the point is I'm confirming that
there is no forward looking plan!

And who ever did was it was based on probably strawman hypothetical argument that wasn't
grounded in reality.

This doesn't need to continue like the debates :-) Pun intended :-)

I don't think it makes any sense to have an abstract strawman argument
design discussion. Yi is looking into for pasid management alone. Rest 
of the IOMMU related topics should wait until we have another 
*real* use requiring consolidation. 

Contrary to your argument, vDPA went with a half blown device only 
iommu user without considering existing abstractions like containers 
and such in VFIO is part of the reason the gap is big at the moment.
And you might not agree, but that's beside the point. 

Rather than pivot ourselves around hypothetical, strawman,
non-intersecting, suggesting architecture without having done a proof of
concept to validate the proposal should stop. We have to ground ourselves
in reality.

The use cases we have so far for SIOV, VFIO and mdev seem to be the right
candidates and addresses them well. Now you might disagree, but as noted we
all agreed to move past this.
