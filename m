Hi Yi,

No exactly. Each domain has a specific default pasid, no matter normal
domain (RID based) or aux-domain (PASID based). The difference is for a
normal domain RID2PASID value is used, for an aux-domain the pasid is
allocated from a global pool.

The same concept used in VT-d 3.x scalable mode. For RID based DMA
translation RID2PASID value is used when walking the tables; For PASID
based DMA translation a real pasid in the transaction is used.

A domain's counterpart is IOMMU group. So we say attach/detach domain
to/from devices in a group. We don't allow devices with different
default pasid sitting in a same group, right?

No. We will have two IOMMU groups and two domains. Correct me if my
understanding is not right.

Best regards,
