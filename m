IMO, the issue is probably in device/system side, since completion latency is
increased a lot, meantime submission latency isn't changed.

Either the submission isn't committed to hardware in time, or the
completion status isn't updated to HW in time from viewpoint of CPU.

We have tried to update to new FW, but not see difference made.

io_polling is supposed to improve IO latency a lot compared with irq
mode, and the perf data shows that clearly on x86_64.

You may try to compare irq mode and polling and narrow down the possible
reasons, no exact suggestion on how to investigate it, :-(
