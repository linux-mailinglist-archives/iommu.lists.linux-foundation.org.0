So, to be clear, what you would like to see would be Kconfig entries
to create a config option, say "NR_DMARS", set up so the default is:

     MAXSMP?  640
     X86_64?  128
     X86_32?  64
     other    64

And DMAR_UNITS_SUPPORTED gets removed, and everywhere it was used we
use CONFIG_NR_DMARS in its place?

I can give that a shot but wanted to confirm this is what you'd want
first.

Thanks,

--> Steve
