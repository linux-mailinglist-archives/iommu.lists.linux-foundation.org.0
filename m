We should still consider relaxable regions as being able to merge back 
in to regular direct regions to a degree - If a relaxable region falls 
entirely within a direct one then there's no point exposing it because 
the direct region *has* to take precedence and be enforced. If there is 
an incomplete overlap then we could possibly just trust consumers to see 
it and give the direct region precedence themselves, but since the 
relaxable region is our own in-kernel invention rather than firmware 
gospel I think it would be safer to truncate it to just its 
non-overlapping part.

Robin.
