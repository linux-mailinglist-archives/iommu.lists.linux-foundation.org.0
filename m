Yes, from previous discussions I believe the HiSilicon implementations 
don't have much meaningful ID information at all (hence why we have to 
match ACPI table headers to identify the counter erratum). My trick only 
works for Arm Ltd. implementations since they happen to have the IMP-DEF 
CoreSight registers with the same information as would be in the future 
IIDR.

To clarify, the proposal at this point is to write up JSON files for 
MMU-600/MMU-700, based on this patch, in order to pipe-clean the process 
for future SMMUv3.3 PMCG implementations with real IIDRs.

Whether other implementers might retroactively define "equivalent" IIDR 
values for their existing implementations in a way we could potentially 
quirk in the driver is an orthogonal question.

Cheers,
Robin.
