If by "classic" you mean conventional PCI bus, then this is much worse
than simply "at risk".  The IOMMU cannot differentiate devices behind a
PCIe-to-PCI bridge, so the moment you turn on the IOMMU context for the
NIC, the address space for your HBA is pulled out from under it.  In
the vfio world, the NIC and HBA are grouped and managed together, the
user cannot change the IOMMU context of a group unless all of the
devices in the group are "viable", ie. they are released from any host
drivers.

vfio users are extremely aware of grouping, they understand the model,
if not always the reason for the grouping.  You only need to look at
r/VFIO to find various lsgroup scripts and kernel patches to manipulate
grouping.  The visibility to the user is valuable imo.

And without a group representation to userspace, how would a user know
to resolve that?

But not discoverable to the user.

So the group still exist in sysfs, they just don't have vfio
representations?  An implicit grouping does what, automatically unbind
the devices, so an admin gives a user access to the NIC but their HBA
device disappears because they were implicitly linked?  That's why vfio
basis ownership on the group, if a user owns the group but the group is
not viable because a device is still bound to another kernel driver,
the use can't do anything.  Implicitly snarfing up subtly affected
devices is bad.

I'm not sold.  Ideally each device would be fully isolated, then we
could assume a 1:1 relation of group and device and collapse the model
to work on devices.  We don't live in that world and I see a benefit to
making that explicit in the uapi, even if that group fd might seem
superfluous at times.  Thanks,

Alex
