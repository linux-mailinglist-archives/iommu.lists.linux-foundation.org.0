Just to add another voice here, I have some colleagues working on 
drivers where they want to use SMMU Substream IDs for a single hardware 
block to operate on multiple iommu_domains managed entirely within the 
kernel. Using an mdev-like approach with aux domains is pretty much the 
ideal fit for this use-case, while all the IOASID discussion appears 
centred on SVA and userspace interfaces, and as such barely relevant if 
at all.

I seem to recall a non-trivial amount of effort going into the aux 
domain design too, so the promise of replacing it with "a big TBD" just 
because vfio-mdev turned out to be awful hardly fills me with enthusiasm 
either :/

Robin.
