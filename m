I think you could hack device_def_domain_type() to return
IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY for the real device, and IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA for
the subdevice.

But I got curious as to why my subdevice might be IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA, so
I checked, and found out that my assumptions weren't quite correct.
The subdevice has no iommu domain recorded at all. Before applying any
patches here, what's actually happening is:

1. Real DMA device gets registered with the iommu as
IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY using si_domain.
2. When the subdevice gets registered, the relevant code flow is
inside dmar_insert_one_dev_info():
 - it creates a new device_domain_info and domain->domain.type == IDENTITY, but
 - it then calls find_domain(dev) which successfully defers to the
real DMA device and returns the real DMA device's dmar_domain
 - since found != NULL (dmar_domain was found for this device) the
function bails out before setting dev->archdata.iommu

The results at this point are that the real DMA device is fully
registered as IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY using si_domain, but all of the
subdevices will always have dev->archdata.iommu == NULL.

Then when intel_map_page() is reached for the subdevice, it calls
iommu_need_mapping() for the subdevice.
This calls identity_mapping() on the subdevice, but that will always
return 0 because dev->archdata.iommu == NULL.
Following on from there, iommu_need_mapping() will then *always*
return true (mapping needed) for subdevices.

That will then lead to the situation described in my last mail, where
later down the allocation chain the request for creating a mapping
will be handed towards the real DMA dev, but that will then fail
because the real DMA dev is using IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY where no
mapping is needed.

Unless I missed anything that seems pretty clear to me now, and I
guess the only reason why you may not have already faced this in the
vmd case is if the real DMA device is not using IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY.
(To check this, you could log the value of the real dev
domain->domain.type in dmar_insert_one_dev_info(), and/or observe the
return value of identity_mapping() in iommu_need_mapping for the real
dev).

In any case it seems increasingly clear to me that
iommu_need_mapping() should be consulting the real DMA device in the
identity_mapping check, and your patch likewise solves the problem
faced here.

Thanks
Daniel
