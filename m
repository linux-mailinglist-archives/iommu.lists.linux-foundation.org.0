Right, but that only applies for alloc_iova_fast() itself - once the 
CPUs have each got their distinct IOVA region, they can then pile into 
iommu_map() completely unhindered (and the inverse for the unmap path).

Well, I think the de-facto rule is that you technically *can* make 
overlapping requests, but one or both may fail, and the final outcome in 
terms of what ends up mapped in the domain is undefined (especially if 
they both succeed). The only real benefit of enforcing serialisation 
would be better failure behaviour in such cases, but it remains 
fundamentally nonsensical for callers to make contradictory requests 
anyway, whether concurrently or sequentially, so there doesn't seem much 
point in spending effort on improving support for nonsense.

I'm not entirely sure what you mean there, but in general an unmap 
request is expected to match some previous map request - there isn't a 
defined API-level behaviour for partial unmaps. They might either unmap 
the entire region originally mapped, or just the requested part, or 
might fail entirely (IIRC there was some nasty code in VFIO for 
detecting a particular behaviour). Similarly for unmapping anything 
that's already not mapped, some drivers treat that as a no-op, others as 
an error. But again, this is even further unrelated to concurrency.

Oh, I've spent the last couple of weeks hacking up horrible things 
manipulating entries in init_mm, and never realised that that was 
actually the special case. Oh well, live and learn.

Robin.
