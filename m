I absolutely agree.  Which is exactly why I'm advocating that
userspace should request from the kernel what it needs (providing a
*minimum* of information) and the kernel satisfies that (filling in
the missing information as suitable for the platform) or outright
fails.

I think that is more robust across multiple platforms and usecases
than advertising a bunch of capabilities and forcing userspace to
interpret those to work out what it can do.

Absolutely, DPDK should not provide that.  qemu *should* provide that,
because the specific IOVAs matter to the guest.  That will inevitably
mean that the request is more likely to fail, but that's a fundamental
tradeoff.

See... to me this is contrary to the point we agreed on above.

This seems the wrong way around to me.  I see qemu as providing logic
to emulate each target IOMMU.  Where that matches the host, there's
the potential for an accelerated implementation, but it makes life a
lot easier if we can at least have a fallback that will work on any
sufficiently capable host IOMMU.

Absolutely not.  But it *is* the kernel's job to let qemu do as mach
as it can with the *host* IOMMU.

Right... seems like we're agreeing again.

Absolutely, the current situation is a mess.

Those are certainly wrong, but they came about explicitly by *not*
being generic rather than by being too generic.  So I'm really
confused aso to what you're arguing for / against.

I can certainly see the case for that approach.  That seems utterly at
odds with what /dev/iommu is trying to do, though.

Probably not what you want ideally, but it's a really useful fallback
case to have.
