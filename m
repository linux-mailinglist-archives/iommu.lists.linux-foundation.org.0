My first guess was that this is done to partition the available address
address space in a way that allows one physical IOTLB to handle
multiple devices that each have their own page table for a subset
of the address space, as was done on old PowerPC IOMMUs.
However, the ranges you list don't really support that model.

This looks like they are reserving some address space in the beginning
and/or the end, and for apciec0, the address space is partitioned into
two equal-sized regions.

Here I also see a "pio-vm-size" property:

    dart-pmp {
      pio-vm-base = <0xc0000000>;
      pio-vm-size = <0x40000000>;
      vm-size = <0xbff00000>;
      ...
   };

Which seems to give 3GB of address space to the normal iotlb,
plus the last 1GB to something else. The vm-base property is also
missing rather than zero, but that could just be part of their syntax
instead of a real difference.

Could it be that there are

>   dart-sio: 0021c000 fbde4000 (at least their Secure Enclave/TPM co-processor)

Same here:
    dart-sio {
       vm-base = <0x0>;
       vm-size = <0xfc000000>;
       pio-vm-base = <0xfd000000>;
      pio-vm-size = <0x2000000>;
      pio-granularity = <0x1000000>;
   }

There are clearly two distinct ranges that split up the 4GB space again,
with a small hole of 16MB (==pio-granularity) at the end of each range.

The "pio" name might indicate that this is a range of addresses that
can be programmed to point at I/O registers in another device, rather
than pointing to RAM.

           Arnd
