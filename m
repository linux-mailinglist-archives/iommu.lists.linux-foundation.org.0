The iommu_group can guarantee the isolation among different physical
devices (represented by RIDs). But when it comes to sub-devices (ex. 
mdev or vDPA devices represented by RID + SSID), we have to rely on the
device driver for isolation. The devices which are able to generate sub-
devices should either use their own on-device mechanisms or use the
platform features like Intel Scalable IOV to isolate the sub-devices.

Under above conditions, different sub-device from a same RID device
could be able to use different IOASID. This seems to means that we can't
support mixed mode where, for example, two RIDs share an iommu_group and
one (or both) of them have sub-devices.

AIUI, when we attach a "RID + SSID" to an IOASID, we should require that
the RID doesn't share the iommu_group with any other RID.

Best regards,
baolu
