As far as I can tell, these pools work with both static allocations (which
seem to match your use-case where firmware has preconfigured the DMA ranges)
but also with dynamic allocations where a 'size' property is present instead
of the 'reg' property and the kernel is responsible for allocating the
reservation during boot. Am I right and, if so, is that deliberate?

I ask because I think that would potentially be useful to us for the
Protected KVM work, where we need to bounce virtio memory accesses via
guest-determined windows because the guest memory is generally inaccessible
to the host. We've been hacking this using a combination of "swiotlb=force"
and set_memory_{decrypted,encrypted}() but it would be much better to
leverage the stuff you have here.

I find this example a bit weird, as I didn't think we usually had DT nodes
for PCI devices; rather they are discovered as a result of probing config
space. Is the idea that you have one reserved memory region attached to the
RC and all the PCI devices below that share the region, or is there a need
for a mapping mechanism?
