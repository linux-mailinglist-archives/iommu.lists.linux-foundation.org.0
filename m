It is???  That would be a problem.

The interesting thing about this test sequence seems to be how it will
implicitly switch between super pages and regular pages.  Also note
that the test is using the original vfio type1 API rather than the v2
API that's more commonly used today.  This older API allows unmaps to
split mappings, but we don't really know how much the IOMMU is
unmapping without reading the unmap.size field returned by the ioctl.
What I expect to happen is that the IOMMU will make use of superpages
when mapping the full range.  When we unmap {0-bffff}, that's likely
going to be covered by a 2M (or more) superpage, therefore the unmap
will actually unmap {0-1fffff}.  The subsequent unmap starting at
0xc0000 might already have {a0000-1fffff} unmapped.  However, when we
then map {0 - bffff} the IOMMU will (should) switch back to 4K pages.
The mapping at 0xc0000 should use 4K pages up through 0x1fffff, then
might switch to 2M or 1G pages depending on physical memory layout.  So
the {0-2MB} IOVA range could be switching back and forth between a
superpage mapping and 4K mapping, and I can certainly imagine that
could lead to page table, if not cache management bugs.  Thanks,

Alex
