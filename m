I'd say it's largely down to whether you want the bother of 
communicating a dynamic behaviour change into io-pgtable. The big 
advantage of having it just use DBM all the time is that you don't have 
to do that, and the "start tracking" operation is then nothing more than 
a normal "read and clear" operation but ignoring the read result.

At this point I'd much rather opt for simplicity, and leave the fancier 
stuff to revisit later if and when somebody does demonstrate a 
significant overhead from using DBM when not strictly needed.

Thanks,
Robin.
