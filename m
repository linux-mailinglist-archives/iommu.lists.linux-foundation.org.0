Sure, the dynamic switch is what makes it ultimately work for Doug's 
use-case (where the unbind isn't viable), but I had every expectation 
that we might need to hold back those two patches for much deeper 
consideration. It's no accident that the first 22 patches can still be 
usefully applied without them!

In all honesty I don't really like this particular patch much, mostly 
because I increasingly dislike IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT at all, but 
since the interface was there it made it super easy to prove the 
concept. I have a more significant refactoring of the io-pgtable code 
sketched out in my mind already, it's just going to be more work.

Good point, I guess that already technically applies (if iovad->fq sat 
in a write buffer long enough), but it certainly becomes far easier to 
provoke. However a barrier after assigning fq_domain (as mentioned 
above) paired with the control dependency around the queue_iova() call 
would also fix that, right?

In other words, IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT is definitely the problem. 
I'll have a hack on that this afternoon, and if it starts to look 
rabbit-holey I'll split this bit off and post v3 of the rest of the series.

If all the io-pgtable and fq behaviour for a given call could be 
consistent based on a single READ_ONCE(cookie->fq_domain) in 
iommu_dma_unmap(), do you see any remaining issues other than the point 
above?

Thanks,
Robin.
