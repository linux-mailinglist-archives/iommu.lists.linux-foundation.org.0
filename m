Yes, this is what I understand you.

But when a domain becomes capable after detaching a device, the upper layer
still needs to query it and enable dirty log for it...

To make things coordinated, maybe the upper layer can register a notifier,
when the domain's capability change, the upper layer do not need to query, instead
they just need to realize a callback, and do their specific policy in the callback.
What do you think?

OK, I see.
