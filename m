I had drivers in guest userspace in mind.

And can it access any guest physical address?

Unfortunately flag negotiation is done through config space
and so can be overwritten by the driver.

Again ACCESS_PLATFORM has a pretty open definition. It does actually
say it's all up to the platform.

Specifically how will VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM_NO_TRANSLATION be
implemented portably? virtio has no portable way to know
whether DMA API bypasses translation.
