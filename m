I agree. When it was originally added it was only the DMAR (Intel) based
platforms that provided this hint so adding an abstraction for that did
not make much sense. Now, since we are seeing more and more USB4 host
controllers and many of them support PCIe tunneling (and IOMMU) adding
an API makes more sense.

I would still leave that policy to userspace to decide.
