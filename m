There world is a lot bigger than just mdev and vfio.

Do I have to type PASID/stream id/etc/etc in every place? We all know
this is gerenal, it is why Intel is picking IOASID for the uAPI name.

mdev is really gross, new things should avoid using it. It is also
100% VFIO specific and should never be used outside VFIO.

My recent work significantly eliminates the need for mdev at all, the
remaining gaps have to do with the way mdev hackily overrides the
iommu mechanisms in VFIO.

Tying any decision to the assumption that mdev will, or even should,
continue is not aligned with the direction things are going.

Well, I'm sorry, but there is a huge other thread talking about the
IOASID design in great detail and why this is all needed. Jumping into
this thread without context and basically rejecting all the
conclusions that were reached over the last several weeks is really
not helpful - especially since your objection is not technical.

I think you should wait for Intel to put together the /dev/ioasid uAPI
proposal and the example use cases it should address then you can give
feedback there, with proper context.

In this case the mdev specific auxdomain for PASID use is replaced by
sane /dev/ioasid objects - and how that gets implemented through the
iommu layer would still be a big TBD. Though I can't forsee any
quality implementation of /dev/ioasid being driven by a one io page
table per struct device scheme.

Hopefully Intel will make the reasons why, and the use cases
supporting the desgin, clear in their RFC.

Expect mdev is basically legacy too.
