`git grep iommu_attach_group -- :^drivers/iommu :^include`

Did I really have to explain that?

The drivers other than vfio_iommu_type1, however, do have a complete 
failure to handle, or even consider, any group that does not fit the 
particular set of assumptions they are making, but at least they only 
work in a context where that should not occur.

You've lost me again; how are those intentions any different? Attaching 
one device to a private domain is a literal subset of attaching more 
than one device to a private domain. There is no "abuse" of any API 
anywhere; the singleton group restriction exists as a protective measure 
because iommu_attach_device() was already in use before groups were 
really a thing, in contexts where groups happened to be singleton 
already, but anyone adding *new* uses in contexts where that assumption 
might *not* hold would be in trouble. Thus it enforces DMA ownership by 
the most trivial and heavy-handed means of simply preventing it ever 
becoming shared in the first place.

Yes, I'm using the term "DMA ownership" in a slightly different context 
to the one in which you originally proposed it. Please step out of the 
userspace-device-assignment-focused bubble for a moment and stay with me...

So then we have the iommu_attach_group() interface for new code (and 
still nobody has got round to updating the old code to it yet), for 
which the basic use-case is still fundamentally "I want to attach my 
thing to my domain", but at least now forcing explicit awareness that 
"my thing" could possibly be inextricably intertwined with more than 
just the one device they expect, so potential callers should have a good 
think about that. Unfortunately this leaves the matter of who "owns" the 
group entirely in the hands of those callers, which as we've now 
concluded is not great.

One of the main reasons for non-singleton groups to occur is due to ID 
aliasing or lack of isolation well beyond the scope and control of 
endpoint devices themselves, so it's not really fair to expect every 
IOMMU-aware driver to also be aware of that, have any idea of how to 
actually handle it, or especially try to negotiate with random other 
drivers as to whether it might be OK to take control of their DMA 
address space too. The whole point is that *every* domain attach really 
*has* to be considered "shared" because in general drivers can't know 
otherwise. Hence the easy, if crude, fix for the original API.

Because there's only one problem to solve! We have the original API 
which does happen to safely enforce ownership, but in an implicit way 
that doesn't scale; then we have the second API which got past the 
topology constraint but unfortunately turns out to just be unsafe in a 
slightly different way, and was supposed to replace the first one but 
hasn't, and is a bit clunky to boot; now you're proposing a third one 
which can correctly enforce safe ownership for any group topology, which 
is simply combining the good bits of the first two. It makes no sense to 
maintain two bad versions of a thing alongside one which works better.

I don't see why anything would be a giant API with a bunch of parameters 
- depending on how you look at it, this new proposal is basically either 
iommu_attach_device() with the ability to scale up to non-trivial groups 
properly, or iommu_attach_group() with a potentially better interface 
and actual safety. The former is still more prevalent (and the interface 
argument compelling), so if we put the new implementation behind that, 
with the one tweak of having it set DMA_OWNER_PRIVATE_DOMAIN 
automatically, kill off iommu_attach_group() by converting its couple of 
users, and not only have we solved the VFIO problem but we've also 
finally updated all the legacy code for free! Of course you can have a 
separate version for VFIO to attach with DMA_OWNER_PRIVATE_DOMAIN_USER 
if you like, although I still fail to understand the necessity of the 
distinction.

Nope. VFIO has its own logic to deal with groups because it's the only 
thing that's ever actually tried dealing with groups correctly 
(unsurprisingly, given that it's where they came from), and every other 
private IOMMU domain user is just crippled or broken to some degree. All 
that proves is that we really should be policing groups better in the 
IOMMU core, per this series, because actually fixing all the other users 
to properly validate their device's group would be a ridiculous mess.

What VFIO wants is (conceptually[1]) "attach this device to my domain, 
provided it and any other devices in its group are managed by a driver I 
approve of." Surprise surprise, that's what any other driver wants as 
well! For iommu_attach_device() it was originally implicit, and is now 
further enforced by the singleton group restriction. For Tegra/host1x 
it's implicit in the complete obliviousness to the possibility of that 
not being the case.

Of course VFIO has a struct device if it needs one; it's trivial to 
resolve the member(s) of a group (and even more so once we can assume 
that a group may only ever contain mutually-compatible devices in the 
first place). How do you think vfio_bus_type() works?

VFIO will also need a struct device anyway, because once I get back from 
my holiday in the new year I need to start working with Simon on 
evolving the rest of the API away from bus->iommu_ops to dev->iommu so 
we can finally support IOMMU drivers coexisting[2].

Indeed I agree with that second point, I'm just increasingly baffled how 
it's not clear to you that there is only one fundamental use-case here. 
Perhaps I'm too familiar with the history to objectively see how unclear 
the current state of things might be :/

I am in complete agreement with that (to the point of also not liking 
patch #6).

I am in complete agreement with that (given "both" of the supposed 3 
use-cases all being the same).

Nope, vfio_iommu_type1 is just a driver, calling the IOMMU API just like 
any other driver. I like the little bit where it passes itself to 
vfio_register_iommu_driver(), which I feel gets this across far more 
poetically than I can manage.

Thanks,
Robin.

[1] Yes, due to the UAPI it actually starts with the whole group rather 
than any particular device within it. Don't nitpick.
