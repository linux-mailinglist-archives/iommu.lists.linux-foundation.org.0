Yes. That's exactly we have done in userspace for the applications which
can directly call UADK (the user-space accelerator framework based on
uacce) to use accelerators for zip, encryption:

+-------------------------------------------+
 |                                           |
 |applications using accelerators            |
 +-------------------------------------------+


     alloc from pool             free to pool
           +                      ++
           |                       |
           |                       |
           |                       |
           |                       |
           |                       |
           |                       |
           |                       |
+----------+-----------------------+---------+
|                                            |
|                                            |
|      HugeTLB memory pool                   |
|                                            |
|                                            |
+--------------------------------------------+

Those applications can get memory from the hugetlb pool and avoid
IO page faults.

The problem is that not every application can do this. Many applications
such as Nginx, Ceph,  are just calling zlib/openssl to use accelerators,
they are not calling the UADK pool based on HugeTLB and they are not
customized.

"vm.compact_unevictable_allowed=0 + mlock + numa_balancing disabling"
which David Rientjes mentioned seem to be a good direction to
investigate on. but it would be better if those settings only affect
the specific process using SVA.
