Right, information on the allocation pattern would help with this change
and also the choice of IOVA allocation algorithm. Without it, we're just
shooting in the dark.

Agreed, reusing CONFIG_CMA_ALIGNMENT makes a lot of sense here as callers
relying on natural alignment of DMA buffer allocations already have to
deal with that limitation. We could fix it as an optional parameter at
init time (init_iova_domain()), and have the DMA IOMMU implementation
pass it in there.
