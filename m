So, "iommu group" isn't a perfect name.  It came about because
originally the main mechanism for isolation was the IOMMU, so it was
typically the IOMMU's capabilities that determined if devices were
isolated.  However it was always known that there could be other
reasons for failure of isolation.  To simplify the model we decided
that we'd put things into the same group if they were non-isolated for
any reason.

The kernel has no notion of "isolation group" as distinct from "iommu
group".  What are called iommu groups in the kernel now *are*
"isolation groups" and that was always the intention - it's just not a
great name.

Yeah, that's not ideal.

I'm not really clear on what that last statement means.

This will *typically* be true of modern devices, but I don't think we
can really make it a hard API distinction.  Legacy or buggy bridges
can force modern devices into the same group as each other.  Modern
devices are not immune from bugs which would force lack of isolation
(e.g. forgotten debug registers on function 0 which affect other
functions).
