Was it documented anywhere that the RMR spec mandated Device
or Normal-NC memory attributes? I have read through the spec
pretty thoroughly and not seen this requirement documented
anywhere. Also please feel free to point out where we can find information
regarding how the spec is being revised. I am on causeway and in
all the SC meetings and haven't seen this topic brought up at all.

Oh the "other" comments where after 7 series of patches you decided
that the approach that was agreed upon on the mailing list was no longer
to your liking? Not to mention the month the patchset sat idle after initial
comments from Ard that were cleared up, when I pinged the thread
and it was ignored. If there was some sort of prompt response on the
threads by the maintainers with accurate information about why the
patches were being held up, or that they were working on a new
spec maybe developers would have bothered to push the patchset forward.
There is no misinformation on Twitter.  After 7 series on a patchset after
initial discussion that it would be designed so device-tree could leverage
the backend work, you just changed your mind, and basically sent
everything back to the start.  Meanwhile only now in this thread are we
finding out that the spec is getting re-worked again, which means that
we will need to update our firmware, and wait for someone to write patches
for the new spec, because guess what?... Arm didn't write the patches
for any of the initial specs.

Arm maintainers should be helping to find ways to get Arm "specifications",
integrated for SystemReady customers to use.  Instead we get delayed
responses, about right turns on the path of the patches, or just outright
ignored for a month at a time. Maybe if Arm developers had actually
written the patches when the spec was released there wouldn't have been
almost a year of wasted time by the hardware manufacturers actually
trying to build and deploy products.
