We've been working on the new fault reporting API with Jacob and Eric,
and I intend to send it out soon. It is supposed to be used for
reporting faults to guests via VFIO, handling page faults via mm, and
also reporting events directly to device drivers. Please let us know
what works and what doesn't in your case

The most recent version of the patches is at
http://www.linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-jpb.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/sva/api
(git://www.linux-arm.org/linux-jpb.git branch sva/api). Hopefully on the
list sometimes next week, I'll add you on Cc.

In particular, see commits
	iommu: Introduce device fault data
	iommu: Introduce device fault report API
	iommu: Add recoverable fault reporting

The device driver calls iommu_register_device_fault_handler(dev, cb,
data). To report a fault, the SMMU driver calls
iommu_report_device_fault(dev, fault). This calls into the device driver
directly, there isn't any workqueue. If the fault is recoverable (the
SMMU driver set type IOMMU_FAULT_PAGE_REQ rather than
IOMMU_FAULT_DMA_UNRECOV), the device driver calls iommu_page_response()
once it has dealt with the fault (after sleeping if it needs to). This
invokes the SMMU driver's resume callback.

At the moment we use mutexes, so iommu_report_device_fault() can only be
called from an IRQ thread, which is incompatible with the current SMMUv2
driver. Either we need to switch the SMMUv2 driver to an IRQ thread, or
rework the fault handler to be called from an IRQ handler. The reporting
also has to be per device rather than per domain, and I'm not sure if
the SMMUv2 driver can deal with this.

At the moment we're keeping the new fault reporting mechanism separate
from iommu_set_fault_handler()/report_iommu_fault(), to ease the transition.

Thanks,
Jean
