Okay, I don't see how sysfs would work in that case either. You can't
assume the driver is not available until after sysfs. But I'll defer
to others...

You want me to do the hard part? ;)

Would this work as a flag in iommus cell (either another cell or bit
in the existing cell)?

You could go the compatible match list route as well. At least until
you work out the kernel implementation.
