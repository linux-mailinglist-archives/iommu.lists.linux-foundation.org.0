OK, thanks for clarifying. My gut feeling is that drivers should 
probably only be calling the noncontiguous API when they *know* that 
they have a scatter-gather-capable device or IOMMU that can cope with 
it, but either way I'm still not convinced that it makes sense to hack 
up SWIOTLB with DT ABI baggage for an obscure fallback case. It would 
seem a lot more sensible to fix alloc_single_sgt() to not ignore 
per-device pools once it has effectively fallen back to the normal 
dma_alloc_attrs() flow, but I guess that's not technically guaranteed to 
uphold the assumption that we can allocate struct-page-backed memory.

Still, if we've got to the point of needing to use a SWIOTLB pool as 
nothing more than a bad reinvention of CMA, rather than an actual bounce 
buffer, that reeks of a fundamental design issue and adding more hacks 
on top to bodge around it is not the right way to go - we need to take a 
step back and properly reconsider how dma_alloc_noncontiguous() is 
supposed to interact with DMA protection schemes.

Thanks,
Robin.
