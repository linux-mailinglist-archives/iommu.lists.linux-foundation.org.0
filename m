Yes, and this needs to be fixed in Linux. The firmware complies with
the pertinent specifications, and it is Linux that deviates from this
for legacy reasons.

IIRC, this came up on the mailing list at some point, and one of the
issues is that I/O port 0x0 is mistaken for 'no resource' or some
other exceptional case like that, so even if we fix the arbitrary
limit of 0x1000, we may still run into trouble when devices uses I/O
port 0x0.
