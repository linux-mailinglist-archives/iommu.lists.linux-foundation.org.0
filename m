Yes it is definitely a bug in the client driver if DMA is performed
after shutdown callback of that respective driver is invoked and it must
be fixed in that driver. But here the problem I was describing is not 
that,
most of the drivers do not have a shutdown callback to begin with and 
adding
it just because of shutdown dependency on SMMU doesn't seem so well 
because
we can have many more such clients in the future and then we have to 
just go
on adding the shutdown callbacks everywhere.

The problem with kexec may not be directly related to SMMU as you said
above if DMA is performed after the client shutdown callback, then its a
bug in the client driver, so that needs to be fixed in the client 
driver,
not the SMMU. So is there any point in having the SMMU shutdown 
callback?
As you see, with this SMMU shutdown callback, we need to add shutdown
callbacks in all the client drivers.

Thanks,
Sai
