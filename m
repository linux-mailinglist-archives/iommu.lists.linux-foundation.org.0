I guess it depends what the aim is - is it just to bail out of 
operations which have near-zero chance of working correctly and every 
chance of going catastrophically wrong, or to lay down strict argument 
checking for the API in general? (for cache-coherent devices, or if the 
caller is careful to ensure the appropriate alignment, DMA from a 
non-virtually-mapped stack can be *technically* fine, it's just banned 
in general because those necessary assumptions can be tricky to meet and 
aren't at all portable).

Robin.
