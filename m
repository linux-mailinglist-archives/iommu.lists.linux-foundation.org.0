Regardless whether we put it in the VIOT or in the virtio-iommu PROBE
request, we necessarily need to reuse the node IDs defined by SRAT (or
numa-node-id on devicetree, also a 32-bit value). A virtio-pci based
virtio-iommu already has the _PXM of its closest bridge and wouldn't need
anything more in the VIOT, while a virtio-mmio based virtio-iommu would
need a proximity domain field in the VIOT. That could be added later since
the table is extensible, but as you pointed out, that information might
not be very useful.

It looks like the user can specify this guest-host mapping on the
command-line:

  -object memory-backend-ram,id=mem0,size=4G,host-nodes=3,policy=bind
  -object memory-backend-ram,id=mem1,size=4G,host-nodes=4,policy=bind
  -numa node,memdev=mem0,nodeid=numa0
  -numa node,memdev=mem1,nodeid=numa1
  -numa cpu,node-id=numa0,socket-id=0
  -numa cpu,node-id=numa1,socket-id=1

numa0 and numa1 would get proximity domains 0 and 1, corresponding to host
domains 3 and 4. It is also possible to specify the NUMA node of a PCI bus
(via the PCI expander bridge), and therefore to assign a VFIO PCI device
in the same proximity domain as its physical location.

  -device pxb,id=bridge1,bus=pci.0,numa_node=1 (simplified)
  -device vfio-pci,host=03:01.0,bus=bridge1

Linux can use this information to allocate DMA close to the endpoint (see
for example __iommu_dma_alloc_pages()). For page tables allocation,
io-pgtables currently takes the node ID of the IOMMU device, not the
endpoint. For the scenario you describe (virtio-iommu endpoints managed by
different physical IOMMU), we would need to take for example the node ID
of the first endpoint in the iommu_domain for which we're allocating page
tables.

Is it safe to assume that the pIOMMU is in the same proximity domain as
the physical endpoint?  If that's the case, then the guest already has all
the information it needs. Otherwise it's easy to add a proximity domain
PROBE property for each endpoint. Configuring the host to pass that
information might be more difficult.


Off topic, I've been wondering how to make iommu-sva aware of NUMA
topology as well, so that when handling a page request we allocate memory
on the faulting device's NUMA node, but I think it might require invasive
changes to the mm subsystem, to pass a NUMA node to handle_mm_fault().

Thanks,
Jean
