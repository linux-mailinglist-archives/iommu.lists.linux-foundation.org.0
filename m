No worries - since it's a networking-focused SoC I figured there was a 
chance you might be using DPDK or similar userspace drivers with the NIC 
VFs, but I was just casting around for a quick and easy baseline of 
whether the SMMU works at all (another way would be using Qemu to run a 
VM with one or more PCI devices assigned).

Curiouser and curiouser... I'm inclined to suspect that the interrupt 
configuration might also be messed up, such that the SMMU is blocking 
traffic and jammed up due to pending faults, but you're not getting the 
IRQ delivered to find out. Does this patch help reveal anything?

http://linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-rm.git;a=commitdiff;h=29ac3648b580920692c9b417b2fc606995826517

(untested, but it's a direct port of the one I've used for SMMUv3 to 
diagnose something similar)

That said, it's also puzzling that no other drivers are reporting DMA 
errors or timeouts either - is there any chance that some device is set 
running by the firmware/bootloader and not taken over by a kernel driver?

Robin.
