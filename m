Ok, but the driver can happily rewrite/ignore what it gets back. I suppose
an alternative would be scrapped the 'u64 tcr' and instead having a bunch
of named bitfields for the stuff we're actually providing, although I'd
still like EPDx to be in there.

I find the EPDx bits particularly dangerous because:

  - They're easily overlooked
  - Clobbering TTBR1 with 0x0 doesn't disable walks via TTBR1 as you might
    reasonably expect
  - If you do the above without EPD, the breakage will be subtle

and given that I don't see any real downsides to us providing a default TCR
value with EPD set appropriately, then I think we should do that. I'd be
happy to revisit the decision later on if it's getting the way of a real
use-case, but it feels like we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater
at the moment and I'd rather do this incrementally based on actual need.

Will
