Yes that sounds simpler for us.

Is it really required to present this shared memory as belonging to a PCI
device? I would expect the device-tree to indicate the presence of this shared
memory region, which we should be able to present to ivshmem2 as shared memory
region to use (along with some handles for doorbell or message queue use).

I understand the usefulness of modeling the shared memory as part of device so
that hypervisor can send events related to peers going down or coming up. In our
case, there will be other means to discover those events and avoiding this
requirement on hypervisor (to emulate PCI) will simplify the solution for us.

Any idea when we can expect virtio over ivshmem2 to become available?!
