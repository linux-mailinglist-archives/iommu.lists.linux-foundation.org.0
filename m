There are up to 1M PASIDs because PASID is 20-bit. I think there are a few ways
to allocate and free PASID:

1. Statically allocate a PASID once a mm is created and free it in mm
   exit. No PASID allocation/free during the mm's lifetime. Then
   up to 1M processes can be created due to 1M PASIDs limitation.
   We don't want this method because the 1M processes limitation.

2. A PASID is allocated to the mm in open(dev)->bind(dev, mm). There
   are three ways to free it:
   (a) Actively free it in close(fd)->unbind(dev, mm) by sending
       IPIs to tell all tasks using the PASID to clear the IA32_PASID
       MSR. This has locking issues similar to the actively loading
       IA32_PASID MSR which was force disabled in upstream. So won't work.
   (b) Passively free the PASID in destroy_context(mm) in mm exit. Once
       the PASID is allocated, it stays with the process for the lifetime. It's
       better than #1 because the PASID is allocated only on demand.
   (c) Passively free the PASID in deactive_mm(mm) or unbind() whenever there
       is no usage as implemented in this series. Tracking the PASID usage
       per task provides a chance to free the PASID on task exit. The
       PASID has a better chance to be freed earlier than mm exit in #(b).

This series uses #2 and #(c) to allocate and free the PASID for a better
chance to ease the 1M PASIDs limitation pressure. For example, a thread
doing open(dev)->ENQCMD->close(fd)->exit(2) will not occupy a PASID while
its sibling threads are still running.

Thanks.
