Hi Kai

+ Alex, since he had some of the early quirks authored.

I have confirmed with Internal documentation that the problem exists on
Comet Lake. But its fixed ICL and TGL generations.

Unfortunately I do not see if the public specupdate documents are for these
generation chipsets to makes sure all root port id's can be captured.

There is also another entry in bugzilla that was forwarded that referred to
Request Redirect Capability to be always disabled as well. This same
workaround also seems to be turning off RR for the root port. I believe it
should fix it as well. But i saw another patch attached.

Can you tell how you reproduce this? just doing a

#echo mem > /sys/power/state

is sufficient with an attached NVMe drive?

Apparently it also requires to disable RR, and I'm not able to confirm if
CML requires that as well. 

pci_quirk_disable_intel_spt_pch_acs_redir() also seems to consult the same
table, so i'm not sure why we need the other patch in bugzilla is required.
