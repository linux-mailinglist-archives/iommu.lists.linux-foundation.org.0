Why not both Intel and AMD? You should explain this in the cover letter.

I'd be more motivated to review and test a full all encompassing x86
solution. It would increase the patch set size but would also give it
a better test coverage, which I think would be a huge plus in such a
complex patch set.

How is it analogous?

What is "the specific state"?

Is this only for Trenchboot? I'm a bit lost. What is it anyway?

What is "SL"?

What are "some" validation and setup tasks?

What is SL securityfs module? Why is it needed? We already have
securityfs file for the event log. Why it needs to be writable?

What SEXIT do and why it is required on the kexec path?
