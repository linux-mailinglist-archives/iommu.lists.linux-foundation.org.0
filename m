Ah, if it's safe to just say "no protection" in the case that we don't 
know for sure, that's even better. Clearly I hadn't quite grasped that 
aspect of the usage model, thanks for the nudge!

The problem that I've been trying to nail down here is that 
dmar_platform_optin() really doesn't mean much for us - I don't know how 
  Windows' IOMMU drivers work, but there's every chance it's not the 
same way as ours. The only material effect that dmar_platform_optin() 
has for us is to prevent the user from disabling the IOMMU driver 
altogether, and thus ensure that iommu_present() is true. Whether or not 
we can actually trust the IOMMU driver to provide reliable protection 
depends entirely on whether it knows the PCIe ports are external-facing. 
If not, we can only *definitely* know what the IOMMU driver will do for 
a given endpoint once that endpoint has appeared behind the port and 
iommu_probe_device() has decided what its default domain should be, and 
as far as I now understand, that's not an option for Thunderbolt since 
it can only happen *after* the tunnel has been authorised and created.

Much as I'm tempted to de-scope back to my IOMMU API cleanup and run 
away from the rest of the issue, I think I can crib enough from the 
existing code to attempt a reasonable complete fix, so let me give that 
a go...

Thanks,
Robin.
