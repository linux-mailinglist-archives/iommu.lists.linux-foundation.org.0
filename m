It seems that the IOASID extension for guest SVA would not affect this series,
will we do any host-guest IOASID translation in the VFIO fault handler?

As you said in Patch 4, we can introduce full end-to-end functionality
before trying to improve performance, and I will drop the pre-mapping patch
in the current stage...

Is there a need that userspace wants more fine grained control over which
mappings are available for faulting? If so, we may evolve the MAP ioctl
to support for specifying the faulting range.

As for the overhead of IOPF, it is unavoidable if enabling on-demand paging
(and page faults occur almost only when first accessing), and it seems that
there is a large optimization space compared to CPU page faulting.

Thanks,
Shenming
