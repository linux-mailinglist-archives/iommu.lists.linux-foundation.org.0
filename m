Hi Thomas. This is actually the IDXD usage for a mediated device passed 
to a guest kernel when we plumb the pass through of IMS to the guest 
rather than doing previous implementation of having a MSIX vector on 
guest backed by IMS. The control block for the mediated device is 
emulated and therefore an emulated MSIX vector will be surfaced as 
vector 0. However the queues will backed by IMS vectors. So we end up 
needing MSIX and IMS coexist running on the guest kernel for the same 
device.
