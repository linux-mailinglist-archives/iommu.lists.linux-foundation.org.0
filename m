This statement is almost entirely right. I will rephrase it to make it
entirely right.   

The hypervisor does not, and can not be aware of the secure VM
requirement that it needs to do some special processing that has nothing
to do with DMA address translation - only the guest side platform code
know that.

BTW: I do not consider 'bounce buffering' as 'DMA address translation'.
DMA address translation, translates CPU address to DMA address.  Bounce
buffering moves the data from one buffer at a given CPU address to
another buffer at a different CPU address.  Unfortunately the current
DMA ops conflates the two.  The need to do 'DMA address translation' 
is something the device can enforce.  But the need to do bounce
buffering, is something that the device should not be aware and should be
entirely a decision made locally by the kernel/driver in the secure VM.
