I'm assuming there are vendor modules using it there, otherwise we wouldn't
have been asked to put it in. Since you work at Qualcomm, maybe you could
talk to your colleagues (Isaac and Patrick) directly?

Correct. But I don't think we should be adding IOMMU_* anything upstream
if we don't have a user.
