The default domain could be passthrough though, right?

This is true currently, we use group semantics with the type1 IOMMU
backend to attach all devices in the group to a secure context,
regardless of the default domain.

By definition an IOMMU group is the smallest set of devices that we
can consider isolated from all other devices.  Therefore devices in a
group are not necessarily isolated from each other.  Therefore if any
device within a group is not isolated, the group is not isolated.  VFIO
needs to know when it's safe to provide userspace access to the device,
but the device isolation is dependent on the group isolation.  The
group is therefore part of this picture whether implicit or explicit.

But if it's the device attachment to the IOASID that provides the
isolation and the user might attach a device to multiple IOASIDs within
the same IOASIDfd, and presumably make changes to the mapping of device
to IOASID dynamically, are we interrupting user access around each of
those changes?  How would vfio be able to track this, and not only
track it per device, but for all devices in the group.  Suggesting a
user needs to explicitly attach every device in the group is also a
semantic change versus existing vfio, where other devices in the group
must only be considered to be in a safe state for the group to be
usable.

The default domain may indeed be a solution to the problem, but we need
to enforce a secure default domain for all devices in the group.  To me
that suggests that binding the *group* to an IOASIDfd is the point at
which device access becomes secure.  VFIO should be able to consider
that the IOASIDfd binding has taken over ownership of the DMA context
for the device and it will always be either an empty, isolated, default
domain or a user defined IOASID.

Maybe the model relative to vfio is something like:

 1. bind a group to an IOASIDfd
    VFIO_GROUP_BIND_IOASID_FD(groupfd, ioasidfd)
 2. create an IOASID label for each device
    VFIO_DEVICE_SET_IOASID_LABEL(devicefd, device_ioasid_label)

VFIO can open access to the device after step 1, the IOASIDfd takes
responsibility for the device IOMMU context.  After step 2, shouldn't
the user switch to the IOASID uAPI?  I don't see why vfio would be
involved in attaching devices to specific IOASID contexts within the
IOASIDfd at that point, we might need internal compatibility
interfaces, but a native IOASID user should have all they need to
attach device labels to IOASIDs using the IOASIDfd at this point.

We'll need to figure out what the release model looks like too.  A
group should hold a reference on the IOASIDfd and each open device
should hold a reference on the group so that the isolation of the group
cannot be broken while any device is open.

So long as the default context is secure, and ideally if IOMMU context

As above, it seems more complete to me to move attach/detach of devices
to IOASIDs using the labels as well.  Thanks,
