Thanks for taking the time to get back to us on this!

This sounded straight forward and cleaner, so I implemented it...

Unfortunately the hypervisor is playing tricks on me when writing to
S2CR registers:
- TRANS writes lands as requested
- BYPASS writes ends up in the register as requested, with type FAULT
- FAULT writes are ignored

In other words, the Qualcomm firmware prevents us from relying on
marking the relevant streams as BYPASS type.


Instead Qualcomm seems to implement "bypass" by setting up stream
mapping, of TRANS type, pointing to a context bank without
ARM_SMMU_SCTLR_M set.

Bjorn
