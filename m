Er, I meant the same semantics as the "DmaProperty". Please also see below.

No, my patch doesn't have to do with this one.

Yes, this is the property that my patch uses. Microsoft has agreed to
update this documentation (in a sideband thread that I also copied you
on), with the updated semantics that this property can be used to
identify any PCI devices that require Kernel DMA protection. i.e. the
property is not restricted to identify "internal PCIe hierarchies"
(starting at root port), but to "any PCI device".

Yes it would. The attack surface is the same. They probably only
thought of devices external to the SoC (starting from a root port)
when designing this property and thus called out internal M.2 PCI
slots. But nowhave realized that this could be opened to any PCI
device.

No, the whole point of doing this (please refer to the discussion on
the previous versions of this patch) was that we want to have a
property that is NOT limited to the root ports only. And we have
reached an agreement with Microsoft about that.

I think we can handle all three cases with "value==1". I will send a
separate patch for the ExternalFacingPort, and will fixup this patch
too).

I'd prefer that too, and can change it to acpi_dev_get_property.

I think unifying ACPI and GPIO systems to use the same code / function
to read the properties might be more work/investigation, because
reading the properties for ACPI system happens much later than DT
systems (For acpi systems, it happens in pci_acpi_setup() which is
called much later). Given that no one wants to use this for DT
systems, I'd prefer for this to be ACPI specific for now, and then we
can solve it for DT once someone needs it.

WDYT?

Thanks & Best regards,
