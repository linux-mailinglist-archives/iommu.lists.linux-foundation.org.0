Let me double confirm if I'm understanding you correctly. So your suggestion
is to have a per-RID PASID namespace, which can be maintainer by IOMMU driver.
right? Take native SVM usage as an example, everytime a process is bound with
a device, a PASID within this RID will be allocated. Am I correct so far?

If yes, then there is a case in which IOTLB efficiency is really low. Let's ay
there is a process bound with multiple devices(RIDs) and has different PASIDs
allocated for each RID. In such case, the PASID values are different for each
RID. As most vendor will do, PASID will be used to tag IOTLB entries. So in such
case, here will be multiple IOTLB entries for a single VA->PA mapping. And the
number of such duplicate IOTLB entries increases linearly per the number of the
device number. Seems not good from performance perspective.

Also, this reservation will be failed if the PASID happens to be occupied
by previous usage. As the PASID translation table is per-VM, ENQCMD in VM
will be a problem under such PASID management model.
