I am saying it's a safe default. Clear VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM if you
have some special needs e.g. you are very sure it's ok to bypass DMA
ops, or you need to support a legacy guest (produced in the window
between virtio 1 support in 2014 and support for
VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM in 2016).

I think it's an RPMesg bug, yes.

I could imagine some future Xen hosts setting a flag somewhere in the
platform capability saying "no xen specific flag, rely on
"VIRTIO_F_ACCESS_PLATFORM". Then you set that accordingly in QEMU.
How about that?
