Quite right.

No. IOMMU can not access region 'A' above.

Yes. Then this patch would be close to the one[1] I sent in v8.

Do I need to split this patch into 2 ones?:
a).the pagetable code that support 34bit PA when MTK quirk is enabled.
It only has the symmetric code handle BIT32/BIT33. Besides, I will add
CONFIG_PHYS_ADDR_T_64BIT in the iopte_to_addr as commented before.

b) MTK code that apply the special "4gb mode" flow. And the "oas" will
always is 34 bit since v7s has already supported our case.
