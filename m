The "standalone" word came from the SMMUv3 spec (IHI0070D.b 10.1):

  The Performance Monitor Counter Groups are standalone monitoring
  facilities and, as such, can be implemented in separate components that
  are all associated with (but not necessarily part of) an SMMU.

So there are multiple options for what "the PMCG is part of".

(a) The SMMU: the spec guarantees that a PMCG is associated with an SMMU.

(b) The MMIO region: may be within the SMMU (as with MMU-600), outside of
    it (as does another implementation, two 64k pages after the SMMU base)
    or, theoretically, within a separate device (e.g. PCIe controller).

(c) The thing being measured: does not necessarily match the MMIO region.
    For example a TBU attached to the PCIe RC but the PMCG MMIO is within
    the SMMU region.

(d) None: the PMCG can be probed and driven separately from the SMMU and
    other components, as demonstrated by Linux.

Which one is normally picked to decide where to insert a devicetree node?
I guess (b)?  I picked (d) so far as the easiest choice.

(a) is also a reasonable choice, being based on the spec, but it might be
confusing to have a PMCG node inside the SMMU node when the MMIO region is
external, possibly belonging to another device. For the same reason we
could discard (c).

(b) feels more natural, although it's not clear what to do when the PMCG
MMIO region is external or adjacent to the SMMU region. Does the node go
inside the SMMU node or one level up?

Thanks,
Jean
