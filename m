Those platforms are doing something inexplicably wrong, then.

"restricted-dma-pool" says that DMA for the device has to be bounced 
through a dedicated pool because it can't be trusted with visibility of 
regular OS memory. "reusable" tells the OS that it's safe to use the 
pool as regular OS memory while it's idle. Do you see how those concepts 
are fundamentally incompatible?

Linux is right to reject contradictory information rather than attempt 
to guess at what might be safe or not.

Furthermore, down at the practical level, a SWIOTLB pool is used for 
bouncing streaming DMA API mappings, while a coherent/CMA pool is used 
for coherent DMA API allocations; they are not functionally 
interchangeable either. If a device depends on coherent allocations 
rather than streaming DMA, it should still have a coherent pool even 
under a physical memory protection scheme, and if it needs both 
streaming DMA and coherent buffers then it can have both types of pool - 
the bindings explicitly call that out. It's true that SWIOTLB pools can 
act as an emergency fallback for small allocations for I/O-coherent 
devices, but that's not really intended to be relied upon heavily.

So no, I do not see anything wrong with the current handling of 
nonsensical DTs here, sorry.

Robin.
