I'd rather not add a PASID lookup in the SMMU event thread, as that
function needs to be fast and there already is a PASID lookup in the IOPF
worker

Probably not useful for SMMU, but I don't see any issue with adding it.

Right I'm still having trouble understanding the whole picture, will need
to read more about this. The main point is not adding too much work in the
mm exit path.
