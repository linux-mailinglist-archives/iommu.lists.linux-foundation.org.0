Please take a step back and think hard about it whether that changelog
makes sense to you a year from now.

Let me walk you through:

You are missing the oportunity to tell a story about the history of this
decision here:

  PASIDs are process wide. It was attempted to use refcounted PASIDs to
  free them when the last thread drops the refcount. This turned out to
  be complex and error prone. Given the fact that the PASID space is 20
  bits, which allows up to 1M processes to have a PASID associated
  concurrently, PASID resource exhaustion is not a realistic concern.

  Therefore it was decided to simplify the approach and stick with lazy
  on demand PASID allocation, but drop the eager free approach and make
  a allocated PASID lifetime bound to the life time of the process.

There is no refcount in play anymore, right? So how does this part of
the changelog make any sense?

This is followed by:

> Two helpers mm_pasid_set() and mm_pasid_drop() are defined in mm because
> the PASID operations handle the pasid member in mm_struct and should be
> part of mm operations. Because IOASID's reference count is not used any

which does not provide much rationale and just blurbs about _what_ the
patch is doing and not about the why and the connection to the
above. And the refcount removal section contradicts the stale text
above.

So this paragraph should be something like this:

  Get rid of the refcounting mechanisms and replace/rename the
  interfaces to reflect this new approach.

Hmm?

Thanks,

        tglx
