Hi Jean

+ Baolu who is looking into this.

I don't think this is true. Baolu is working on an enhancement to this,
I'll quickly summarize this below:

Stop markers are weird, I'm not certain there is any device today that
sends STOP markers. Even if they did, markers don't have a required
response, they are fire and forget from the device pov.

I'm not sure about other IOMMU's how they behave, When there is no space in
the PRQ, IOMMU auto-responds to the device. This puts the device in a
while (1) loop. The fake successful response will let the device do a ATS
lookup, and that would fail forcing the device to do another PRQ. The idea
is somewhere there the OS has repeated the others and this will find a way
in the PRQ. The point is this is less reliable and can't be the only
indication. PRQ draining has a specific sequence. 

The detailed steps are outlined in 
"Chapter 7.10 "Software Steps to Drain Page Requests & Responses"

- Submit invalidation wait with fence flag to ensure all prior
  invalidations are processed.
- submit iotlb followed by devtlb invalidation
- Submit invalidation wait with page-drain to make sure any page-requests
  issued by the device are flushed when this invalidation wait completes.
- If during the above process there was a queue overflow SW can assume no
  outstanding page-requests are there. If we had a queue full condition,
  then sw must repeat step 2,3 above.


To that extent the proposal is as follows: names are suggestive :-) I'm
making this up as I go!

- iommu_stop_page_req() - Kernel needs to make sure we respond to all
  outstanding requests (since we can't drop responses) 
  - Ensure we respond immediatly for anything that comes before the drain
    sequence completes
- iommu_drain_page_req() - Which does the above invalidation with
  Page_drain set.

Once the driver has performed a reset and before issuing any new request,
it does iommu_resume_page_req() this will ensure we start processing
incoming page-req after this point.

I think intel iommmu driver does this today for SVA when pasid is being
freed. Its still important to go through the drain before that PASID can be
re-purposed.

Ashok
