Are drivers really doing streaming DMA mappings that large? If so, that 
seems like it might be worth trying to address in its own right for the 
sake of efficiency - allocating ~5MB of memory twice and copying it back 
and forth doesn't sound like the ideal thing to do.

If it's really about coherent DMA buffer allocation, I thought the plan 
was that devices which expect to use a significant amount and/or size of 
coherent buffers would continue to use a shared-dma-pool for that? It's 
still what the binding implies. My understanding was that 
swiotlb_alloc() is mostly just a fallback for the sake of drivers which 
mostly do streaming DMA but may allocate a handful of pages worth of 
coherent buffers here and there. Certainly looking at the mtk_scp 
driver, that seems like it shouldn't be going anywhere near SWIOTLB at all.
