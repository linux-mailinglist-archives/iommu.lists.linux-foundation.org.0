Right. With all convenience comes security trust. With SVA there is an
expectation that the device has the required security boundaries properly
implemented. FWIW, what is our guarantee today that VF's are secure from
one another or even its own PF? They can also generate transactions with
any of its peer id's and there is nothing an IOMMU can do today. Other than
rely on ACS. Even BusMaster enable can be ignored and devices (malicious
or otherwise) can generate after the BM=0. With SVM you get the benefits of

* Not having to register regions
* Don't need to pin application space for DMA.

Aren't there other security technologies that can address this?

I suppose technology like CET might be able to guard. The general
expectation is code pages and anything that needs to be protected should be
mapped nor writable.
