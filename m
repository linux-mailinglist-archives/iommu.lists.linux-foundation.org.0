'[RFC v16 0/9] SMMUv3 Nested Stage Setup (IOMMU part)' ??

Ahh, I see.

@Christian would it be OK to pursue a model that pins all of guest 
memory upfront?

Yes

That makes sense, thanks for clarifying.

patch 18 does some symbol_get for gfn_to_page (which will drive 
hva_to_pfn under the covers) and kvm_release_pfn_dirty and uses those 
symbols for pin/unpin.

pin/unpin errors in this series are reliant on the fact that RPCIT is 
architected to include a panic response to the guest of 'mappings failed 
for the specified range, go refresh your tables and make room', thus 
allowing this to work for pageable guests.

Agreed this would be unnecessary if we've already mapped all of guest 
memory via a 1st iommu domain.
