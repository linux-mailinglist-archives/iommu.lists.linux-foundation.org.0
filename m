I probably haven't been following fw_devlink as closely as I should,
but does it completely replace -EPROBE_DEFER? From what I can tell
right now it helps optimize the boot ordering but it's not mandatory
(AKA Linux should boot/work fine with fw_devlink=off)?

I tried to follow all the above the best I can and hopefully
understood some of it. ;-)

OK, so what do you think about these points?

* I think you are arguing that IOMMU strictness requirements needs to
be known regardless of whether we have a driver for a given device or
not. So the whole pre_probe stuff is just not right.

* One thing that's been proposed is putting strictness info in the
device tree. In theory on device-tree systems you could still put
strictness info in the per-device nodes assuming that all devices are
actually described in the device tree. That sounds nice, but I can
believe it would be pretty hard to parse backward like this. AKA when
the IOMMU probes it would need to find all the device tree nodes that
would end up grouped together parse their details to find out if they
should be non-strict.

* Instead of putting the details in per-device nodes, maybe it makes
sense to accept that we should be specifying these things at the IOMMU
level? If specifying things at the device tree level then the
device-tree node of the IOMMU itself would just have a list of things
that should be strict/non-strict. ...this could potentially be merged
with a hardcoded list of things in the IOMMU driver based on the IOMMU
compatible string.

Do those sound right?

I still haven't totally grokked the ideal way to identify devices. I
guess on Qualcomm systems each device is in its own group and so could
have its own strictness levels? ...or would it be better to list by
"stream ID" or something like that?

If we do something like this then maybe that's a solution that could
land short-ish term? We would know right at init time whether a given
domain should be strict or non-strict and there'd be no requirements
to transition it.

At the moment I'm mostly focused on QCom platforms, but that's mostly
because they're the first board that I've dealt with that has iommus
on pretty much every peripheral under the sun. That's a _good_ thing,
but it also means it's where we're hitting all these performance
issues. I believe that the usage of "iommus everywhere" is about to
become a lot more widespread across the SoC ecosystem, especially as
they are important for virtualization and that seems to be a hot-topic
these days.

Basically: I could land a short-term hack a solution for me (and
probably this is the right thing for me to do?), but I'm very much
interested in finding a better solution, ideally something that we
could achieve in something less than a year? Am I dreaming?

Yeah, I had this working (at least as far as my testing went)
downstream in the chromeos-5.4 tree. I basically just implemented
"init_context" for the arm-smmu-qcom driver and then if the "struct
device *" passed in matched the SDMMC compatible string I just ORed in
"IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT". That actually seemed to work fine in
the downstream kernel tree but not upstream. I believe it broke in
commit a250c23f15c2 ("iommu: remove DOMAIN_ATTR_DMA_USE_FLUSH_QUEUE")
because the flush queue stopped getting initted.

I think I could revamp my patch series to continue to have the
strictness attributes in the "struct iommu_domain" but just get rid of
the bits in the "struct device" and obviously get rid of the
"pre_probe" patch. Would something like that be acceptable?

It seems like it would be nice, but maybe with the above we could get
by without having to do this?
