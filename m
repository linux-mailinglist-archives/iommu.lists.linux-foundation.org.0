I'm not sure there's really any reason to expect that a supplier's usage 
model when doing things for itself bears any relation to that of its 
consumer(s), so I'd certainly lean towards the "unconditional" argument 
myself.

Of course ideally we'd skip resuming altogether in the map/unmap paths 
(since resume implies a full TLB reset anyway), but IIRC that approach 
started to get messy in the context of the initial RPM patchset. I'm 
planning to fiddle around a bit more to clean up the implementation of 
the new iommu_flush_ops stuff, so I've made a note to myself to revisit 
RPM to see if there's a sufficiently clean way to do better. In the 
meantime, though, I don't have any real objection to using some 
reasonable autosuspend delay on the principle that if we've been woken 
up to map/unmap one page, there's a high likelihood that more will 
follow in short order (and in the configuration slow-paths it won't have 
much impact either way).
