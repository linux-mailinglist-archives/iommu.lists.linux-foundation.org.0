Hmm, the description of the new mapping flag is that it applies only
to transparent outer level cache:

+/*
+ * Non-coherent masters can use this page protection flag to set cacheable
+ * memory attributes for only a transparent outer level of cache, also known as
+ * the last-level or system cache.
+ */
+#define IOMMU_LLC      (1 << 6)

But I suppose we could call it instead IOMMU_QCOM_LLC or something
like that to make it more clear that it is not necessarily something
that would work with a different outer level cache implementation?
