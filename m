Unfortunately I see really weird things coming out of that, e.g. display
on my db845c is waiting for the USB hub on PCIe to load its firmware,
which typically times out after 60 seconds.

I've stared at it quite a bit and I don't understand how they are
related.

I guess we'll have to force QCOM_SCM=y in the defconfig and hope people
don't make it =m.

Right, deferred_probe_timeout is the main issue here. Without it we
might get some weird probe deferral runs, but either some driver is
missing or it settles eventually.

With deferred_probe_timeout it's rather common for me to see things
end up probe out of order (even more now with fw_devlink finding cyclic
dependencies) and deferred_probe_timeout just breaking things.

There's no end to the possible and valid ways you can setup your
defconfig and run into the probe deferral issues, so I see no point in
holding this one back any longer. I just hope that one day it will be
possible to boot the upstream kernel in a reliable fashion.

Thanks,
