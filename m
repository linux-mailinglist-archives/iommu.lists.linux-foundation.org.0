Hypothetically everything back to a3xx, so I *could* see usefulness of
this in qcom_iommu (or maybe even msm-iommu).  OTOH maybe with
"modularizing" arm-smmu we could re-combine qcom_iommu and arm-smmu.
And as a practical matter, I'm not sure if anyone will get around to
backporting per-context pagetables as far back as a3xx.
