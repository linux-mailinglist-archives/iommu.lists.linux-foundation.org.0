Nothing would prevent creating a device tree or ACPI property that
caused either "force-strict" or "request-non-strict" from being set if
everyone agrees that it's a good idea. I wouldn't reject the idea
myself, but I do worry that we'd devolve into the usual bikeshed for
exactly how this should look. I talked about this a bit in my response
to Saravana, but basically:

* If there was some generic property, would we call it "untrusted",
"external", or something else?

* How do you describe "trust" in a generic "objective" way? It's not
really boolean and trying to describe exactly how trustworthy
something should be considered is hard.

* At least for the device tree there's a general requirement that it
describes the hardware and not so much how the software should
configure the hardware. As I understand it there is _some_ leeway here
where it's OK to describe how the hardware was designed for the OS to
configure it, but it's a pretty high bar and a hard sell. In general
the device tree isn't supposed to be used to describe "policy". In
other words: if one OS might decide on one setting and another OS on
another then it doesn't really belong in the device tree.

* In general the kernel is also not really supposed to have policy
hardcoded in either, though it feels like we can get away with having
a good default/sane policy and allowing overriding the policy with
command line parameters (like iommu.strict). In the case where
something has to be configured at bootup there's not many ways to do
better.


tl;dr: I have no plans to try to make an overarching property, but my
patch series does allow subsystems to come up with and easily
implement their own rules as it makes sense. While this might seem
hodgepodge I prefer to see it as "flexible" since I'm not convinced
that we're going to be able to come up with an overarching trust
framework.
