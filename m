Yes, you are right. This patch is to keep the pci_stub's existing use
case ("allows admin to block driver binding") after moving the viable
check from the vfio to iommu layer (done by this series).

About "safe" (should not be part of this description), there are two
sides from my understanding:

#1) The pci_stub driver itself doesn't control the device to do any DMA.
     So it won't interfere the user space through device DMA.

#2) The pci_stub driver doesn't access the PCI bar and doesn't build any
     device driver state around any value in the bar. So other devices
     in the same iommu group (assigned to user space) have no means to
     change the kernel driver consistency via p2p access.

Sure. I will rephrase the description like above.
