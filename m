This doesn't have to be an abuse or attack. It can simply be an error
by the person who wrote the devicetree file. Sure, bugs or lack of
error checking can often be used for attacks, but that doesn't mean
that all bad data is an exploit or attack.

It is an option, but it would need to be explained and would not be
as simple as it looks. And, yes, it would result in unnecessary code
execution.

Why does it need to be explained ? I spent quite some additional
time with the code trying to understand _why_ it works, and we should
make sure that others don't have to spend that time.

Anyway, that additional time made me find additional problems with
the code.

The for loop below assigns larbnode to the last node it finds.
However, that node can be disabled.

		if (!of_device_is_available(larbnode)) {
                         of_node_put(larbnode);
                         continue;
                 }

Is such a disabled larbnode, if it is the last one, the node to use
when looking for "mediatek,smi" ?

Also, there is

	ret = of_property_read_u32(larbnode, "mediatek,larb-id", &id);
         if (ret)/* The id is consecutive if there is no this property */
                 id = i;

There are two problems with this code. First, neither i nor id are range
checked, but used later in

	data->larb_imu[id].dev = &plarbdev->dev;

That means a devicetree with a bad value for "mediatek,larb-id"
or more than MTK_LARB_NR_MAX larb nodes will result in writes after
the end of struct mtk_iommu_data.

On top of that, the comment states that the nodes are consecutive if there
is no "mediatek,larb-id". However, that isn't really the case if there
are disabled nodes. If there are disabled nodes, there will be a gap in
larb_imu[]. I don't know if that matters; if it doesn't, there should be
a comment about it in the code.

Last but not least, it would probably make sense to explain what the "last"
larb node is expected to be in more detail. It is the last larb node in
the devicetree file, but not the one with the highest id, and not
(necessarily) an enabled one. For example, in
arch/arm64/boot/dts/mediatek/mt2712e.dtsi, the code would pick
<&smi_common0> even though <&smi_common1> is associated with a higher
larb id.

One could of course argue that this all doesn't matter because it would
suggest that the devicetree data is bad, but it is common practice to validate
devicetree data and not just blindly accept it. One could also argue
that such bad data would be an "attack", but, again, we don't know that.

In summary,

- The check I introduced should probably be something like

	if (larb_nr == 0 || larb_nr > MTK_LARB_NR_MAX)
		return -EINVAL;

- It needs to be clarified if larbnode to use for finding "mediatek,smi"
   is indeed always the last one, even if it is disabled. If so, we should
   probably also handle the situation that of_node_put(larbnode); was called
   on that larbnode. Alternatively, if the last larb node to use is the last
   _active_ larb node, we'll probably need a separate variable to save that
   larb node pointer for later use.

- It needs to be clarified if larb_imu[] may have gaps if there are disabled
   larb nodes and "mediatek,larb-id" is not specified. If so, there is still the
   problem that 'i' and a previous value of "mediatek,larb-id" may be identical
   [ eg the first node provides mediatek,larb-id = <1> and the second node
     doesn't provide "mediatek,larb-id" ]

- "id" should be range checked.

- The meaning of "last" larb node to use when looking for mediatek,smi should
   be explained in more detail.

Once we have determined the correct handling of all those situations, I'll
be happy to send another revision of this patch (or possibly multiple patches).

Thanks,
Guenter
