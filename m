I agree. If the driver *does* want to use TTBR1 then it gets a bit uglier to
realize that the io-pgtable set the bit and mask it off. To me it is a lot
clearer if this is done explicitly in the driver especially if the driver is
where we are making the choice to use either ttbr0 or ttbr1.

It would probably be easier to see in actual code, and I'll have a patch
shortly on top of this series.
