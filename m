Since allocating, freeing and fixing up PASID are changed, the
documentation is updated to reflect the changes.

+PASID Lifecycle Management
+==========================
+
+Only processes that access SVA-capable devices need to have a PASID
+allocated. This allocation happens when a process opens/binds an SVA-capable
+device but finds no PASID for this process. Subsequent binds of the same, or
+other devices will share the same PASID.
+
+Although the PASID is allocated to the process by opening a device,
+it is not active in any of the threads of that process. It's loaded to the
+IA32_PASID MSR lazily when a thread tries to submit a work descriptor
+to a device using the ENQCMD.
+
+That first access will trigger a #GP fault because the IA32_PASID MSR
+has not been initialized with the PASID value assigned to the process
+when the device was opened. The Linux #GP handler notes that a PASID has
+been allocated for the process, and so initializes the IA32_PASID MSR, takes
+a reference to the PASID and returns so that the ENQCMD instruction is
+re-executed.
+
+On fork(2) or exec(2) the PASID is removed from the process as it no
+longer has the same address space that it had when the device was opened.
+
+On clone(2) the new task shares the same address space, so will be
+able to use the PASID allocated to the process. The IA32_PASID is not
+preemptively initialized as the PASID value might not be allocated yet or
+the kernel does not know whether this thread is going to access the device
+and the cleared IA32_PASID MSR reduces context switch overhead by xstate
+init optimization. Since #GP faults have to be handled on any threads that
+were created before the PASID was assigned to the mm of the process, newly
+created threads might as well be treated in a consistent way.
+
+Due to complexity of freeing the PASID and clearing all IA32_PASID MSRs in
+all threads in unbind, free the PASID lazily when there is no PASID user.
+Track the PASID's reference count in the following way:
+
+- Track device usage of the PASID: The PASID's reference count is initialized
+  as 1 when the PASID is allocated in the first bind. Bind takes a reference
+  and unbind drops the reference.
+- Track task usage of the PASID: Fixing up the IA32_PASID MSR in #GP takes
+  reference and exit(2) drops the reference. Once the MSR is fixed up, the
+  PASID value stays in the MSR stays for the rest life of the task.
+
+The PASID is freed lazily in exit(2) or unbind when there is no reference
+to the PASID. After freed, the PASID can be allocated to any process.
+
+ENQCMD needs at least two requirements: a valid IA32_PASID MSR with the
+PASID value of the process and a valid PASID table entry for the PASID.
+To execute ENQCMD, the user must ensure the device is bound to the
+process so that the kernel can guarantee to meet the above two requirements.
+
+Lazy PASID free may cause the task still has the PASID value in IA32_PASID
+while there is no PASID table entry for the PASID. The workqueue submitted
+by ENQCMD in this scenario cannot find the PASID table entry and generates
+a DMAR fault. Currently DMAR fault handler just prints a fault reason.
+Future DMAR fault handler might notify the user the workqueue failure.
+Here are two detailed cases:
+
+- Unbind removes the PASID table entry but the process still owns the PASID
+  and the task's IA32_PASID MSR still keeps the PASID value. The workqueue
+  submitted by ENQCMD in this task will generate a DMAR fault.
+- Unbind removes the PASID table entry but the process still owns the PASID
+  because some task took one reference during fix up. ENQCMD executed in a
+  task that doesn't fix up the IA32_PASID MSR will generate #GP first to get
+  its IA32_PASID MSR fixed up and then the submitted workqueue will generate
+  a DMAR fault.
