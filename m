I'm confused - if you got a DMA address back, then the allocation must 
have succeeded, so what exactly is the issue there? If the allocator 
managed to find a suitable amount of memory that your device can 
address, does it really matter exactly where it came from?

Also bear in mind that a DMA address is not necessarily the same as a 
physical address anyway, if for instance you have an IOMMU or other 
forms of interconnect translation. In fact the default behaviour of the 
intel-iommu driver for a PCI device is to allocate DMA addresses in 
naturally-aligned regions downwards from 4GB - if the first request in 
an empty address space was for 33MB, it would get rounded up to 64MB, 
wouldn't fit at 4GB - 64MB (0xfc000000) because that would clash with 
the IOAPIC region, so would end up at 4GB - 128MB (0xf8000000). Now 
where have I seen that before?...
