Couldn't you have a driver flag that has the same effect as twiddling 
sysfs? At the being of probe, check the flag and go set the underlying 
sysfs setting in the device.

Though you may want this to be per device, not per driver. To do that 
early, I think you'd need a DT property. I wouldn't be totally opposed 
to that and I appreciate you not starting there. :)
