I assume this is for devTLB since IOMMU's IOTLB flush doesn't care about
device. I think it works for device-wide invalidation.

yes. we can use the same data structure for PASID selective devTLB but 
 list_for_each()
     if (itm->pasid == pasid_to_be_invalidated;
	     invalidate(itm->device, pasid);

For IOMMU's IOTLB, we also have two granularities
1. domain-wide
2. pasid-wide
For #1, we just use DID to invalidate w/o traverse the list.
For #2, we just need to sanity check the pasid is indeed attached by going
through the list.

Seems to work!

Make sense, very neat. Vendor driver would not need to do allocations. Let
me give that a try. Seems #2 has better type safety.

Thank you so much for the thorough explanation!
