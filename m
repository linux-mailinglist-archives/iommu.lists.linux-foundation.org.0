In this case. we will get fault in current SW setting.

I have removed the domid patch in v6. and get the domain id in [27/33]
in v6..

About the other ranges should be dynamical, the commit message [30/33]
of v6 should be helpful. the problem is that we have a bank_sel setting
for the iova[32:33]. currently we preassign this value. thus, all the
ranges are fixed. If you adjust this setting, you can let vcodec access
0~4G.

Currently we have no interface to adjust this setting. Suppose we add a
new interface for this. It would be something like:

   int mtk_smi_larb_config_banksel(struct device *larb, int banksel)
  
   Then, all the MM drivers should call it before the HW works every
time, and its implement will be a bit complex since we aren't sure if
the larb has power at that time. the important thing is that the MM
devices have already not known which larb it connects with as we plan to
delete "mediatek,larb" in their dtsi nodes.

   In current design, the MM device don't need care about it and 4GB
range is enough for them.
