No, I think you're doing the right thing of having them both. I just
didn't remember us doing that.

I do suspect that at some point (probably sooner than later) we'd have
to support both inheriting of stream from the bootloader and the Adreno
"quirks" in the same instance.

But for now this is okay to me.
