Sorry for late response.

uacce and its userspace framework UADK depend on SVA, leveraging
the enhanced security by isolated process address space.

This patch is mainly an extension for performance optimization to
get stable high-performance I/O on pinned memory even though the
hardware supports IO page fault to get pages back after swapping
out or page migration.
But IO page fault will cause serious latency jitter for high-speed
I/O.
For slow speed device, they don't need to use this extension.

Sounds reasonable. On the other hand, uacce seems to be an common
uAPI for SVA, and probably the only one for this moment.

uacce is a framework not a specific driver as any accelerators
can hook into this framework as long as a device provides
uacce_ops and register itself by uacce_register(). Uacce, for
itself, doesn't bind with any specific hardware. So uacce interfaces
are kind of common uAPI :-)
