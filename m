I must have missed something, but why bother with a state when you can
always check if the mm is dead by mmget_not_zero()? You would not
handle IOPF if the mm is dead anyway, similarly for other DMA errors.

Also, since you are not freeing ioasid in mmu_notifier release anymore,
does it mean the IOASID notifier chain can be non-atomic?

Thanks,

Jacob
