->release() is called by exit_mmap which is called by mmput. There are
over a 100 callsites to mmput() and I'm not totally sure what the
rules are for release(). We've run into problems before with things
like this.

IMHO, due to this, it is best for release to be simple and have
conservative requirements on context like all the other notifier
callbacks. It is is not a good place to put complex HW fencing driver
code.

In particular that link you referenced is suggesting the driver tear
down could take minutes - IMHO it is not OK to block mmput() for
minutes.

Errors should not be printed to the kernel log for PASID cases
anyhow. PASID will be used by unpriv user, and unpriv user should not
be able to trigger kernel prints at will, eg by doing dma to nmap VA
or whatever. 

Process exit is just another case of this, and should not be treated
specially.
