It should be possible to do a fake bypass mode by just programming a
static page table for as much address space as you can, and then
use swiotlb to address any memory beyond that. This won't perform
well because it requires bounce buffers for any high memory, but it
can be a last resort if a dart instance cannot do normal bypass mode.

The other second-to-last resort here would be to duplicate the code from
the dma-iommu code and implement the dma-mapping API directly on
top of the dart hardware instead of the iommu layer. This would probably
be much faster than the swiotlb on top of a bypass or a linear map,
but it's a really awful abstraction that would require adding special cases
into a lot of generic code.

I think pretty much all drivers using the iommu API directly already
depends on having a matching page size.  I don't see any way to use
e.g. PCI device assignment using vfio, or a GPU driver with per-process
contexts when the iotlb page size is larger than the CPU's.

I don't know how hard it is to do adjust the dma-iommu implementation
to allow this, but as long as we can work out the DT binding to support
both normal dma-iommu mode with 16KB pages and some kind of
passthrough mode (emulated or not) with 4KB pages, it can be left
as a possible optimization for later.
