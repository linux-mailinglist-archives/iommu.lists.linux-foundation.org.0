Ok, B is a deal breaker.  I just brought this in because I've received
review comments that state bouncing is just the easiest option for
now and we could map it into the hypervisor in the future.  But at
least for SEV that does not seem like an option without hardware
changes.

Agreed to all counts.

Yes, I think doing per-cpu and/or per-node scaling sounds like the
right general approach. Why was this never sent out?

Where was this discussion?
