I was more thinking of an unstable TEST config, like 
DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE. So we know that this particular config breaks 
many platforms. But at least those in the know can turn it on locally 
and detect and fix issues, and strive towards having a platform for 
which it works.

But then it does become a little harder to justify such a config when we 
can enable via commadline.

Of course.
