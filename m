This is about the hardware design. In D06 board, an invalid DMA access from
accelerator devices will be aborted, and an hardware error signal will be
returned to accelerator devices, which reports it as a RAS error irq.
while for the stall case, error signal triggered by SMMU resume abort is
also reported as same RAS error irq. This is problem in D60 board.

In next generation of hardware, a new irq will be added to report SMMU resume
abort information, it works with related registers in accelerator devices to
get related hardware queue, which need to be stopped.

So if CD0.S is 1, invalid DMA access in kernel will be reported into above
new added irq, which has not enough information to tell RAS errors(there are 10+
hardware RAS errors) from SMMU resume abort.

As above, it is hard to tell RAS errors and SMMU resume abort in SMMU resume abort
now :(

As above, if disabling stall for CD0, an invalid DMA access will be handled
by RAS error irq.

If A DMA access in kernel fails, I think there should be a RAS issue :)
So better to disable CD0 stall for DMA domain.

Best,
Zhou
