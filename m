I'll continue to disagree that having tons more code purely for the sake 
of it is cleaner. The high-level requirements are fundamentally 
asymmetrical - ownership has to be actively claimed by the bus code at a 
point during probe where it can block probing if necessary, but it can 
be released anywhere at all during remove since that cannot fail. I 
don't personally see the value in a bunch of code bloat for no reason 
other than trying to pretend that an asymmetrical thing isn't.

We already have other concepts in the IOMMU API, like the domain ops 
lifecycle, which are almost self-contained but for needing an external 
prod to get started, so I'm naturally viewing this one the same way.

Huh? How hard is it to hold group->mutex when reading or writing 
group->owner? Walking the list would only have to be done for 
*releasing* ownership and I'm pretty sure all the races there are benign 
- only probe/remove of the driver (or DMA API token) matching a current 
non-NULL owner matter; if two removes race, the first might end up 
releasing ownership "early", but the second is waiting to do that anyway 
so it's OK; if a remove races with a probe, the remove may end up 
leaving the owner set, but the probe is waiting to do that anyway so 
it's OK.

Again, this does not affect probe at all, only remove, and TBH I'd 
expect the performance impact to be negligible. On any sensible system, 
IOMMU groups are not large. Heck, in the typical case I'd guess it's no 
worse than the time we currently spend on group notifiers. I was just 
making the point that there should not be a significant performance 
argument for needing to cache a count value.

I was looking at iommu_group_remove_device() at the time, but of course 
we should always have seen an unbind before we get there - that one's on 
me, sorry for the confusion.

Eh? Just look at the context of patch #2, let alone the rest of the 
function, and tell me how, if we can't rely on 
BUS_NOTIFY_DRIVER_NOT_BOUND, calling .dma_cleanup *from the exact same 
place* is somehow more reliable?

AFAICS, a notifier handling both BUS_NOTIFY_UNBOUND_DRIVER and 
BUS_NOTIFY_DRIVER_NOT_BOUND would be directly equivalent to the callers 
of .dma_cleanup here.

The current implementation of iommu_group_claim_dma_owner() allows 
owner_cnt to increase beyond 1, and correspondingly requires 
iommu_group_release_dma_owner() to be called the same number of times. 
It doesn't appear that VFIO needs that, and I'm not sure I'd trust any 
other potential users to get it right either.

That's what I'm saying - right now every bus *has* to have a specific 
.dma_configure implementation if only to retrieve a 
semantically-identical flag from each bus-specific structure; there is 
zero possible code-sharing. With a generically-defined flag, there is 
some possibility for code-sharing now (e.g. patch #3 wouldn't be 
needed), and the potential for more in future.

Indeed, so if we're enthusiastic about future cleanup that necessitates 
a generic flag, why not make the flag generic to start with?

Thanks,
Robin.
