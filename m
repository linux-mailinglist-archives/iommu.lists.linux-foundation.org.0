The SVA proposals are being reworked to make use of a new IOASID
object, it's not clear to me that this shouldn't also make use of that
work as it does a significant expansion of the type1 IOMMU with fault
handlers that would duplicate new work using that new model.

It seems like this is only an example that you can make a benchmark
show anything you want.  The best results would be to pre-map
everything, which is what we have without this series.  What is an
acceptable overhead to incur to avoid page pinning?  What if userspace
had more fine grained control over which mappings were available for
faulting and which were statically mapped?  I don't really see what
sense the pre-mapping range makes.  If I assume the user is QEMU in a
non-vIOMMU configuration, pre-mapping the beginning of each RAM section
doesn't make any logical sense relative to device DMA.

Comments per patch to follow.  Thanks,

Alex
