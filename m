There are two scenarios:

(1) for PF/VF, the iommu driver maintains an individual PASID table per
PDF. Although the PASID namespace is global, the per-BDF PASID table
contains only valid entries for those PASIDs which are allocated to the
mm_struct. The user is free to program arbitrary PASID into the assigned
device, but using invalid PASIDs simply hit iommu fault.

(2) for mdev, multiple mdev instances share the same PASID table of
the parent BDF. However, PASID programming is a privileged operation
in multiplexing usage, thus must be mediated by mdev device driver. 
The mediation logic will guarantee that only allocated PASIDs are 
forwarded to the device. 

Thanks
Kevin
