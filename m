Sure, but you are not the normal user.

That is I don't like that for 1GB guests your patch ends up doubling the
SWIOTLB memory pool. That seems to me we are trying to solve a problem
that normal users will not hit. That is why I want 'here is the customer
bug'.

Here is what I am going to do - I will take out the 1GB and 4GB case out of
your patch and call it a day. If there are customers who start reporting issues
we can revist that. Nothing wrong with 'Reported-by' XZY (we often ask the
customer if he or she would like to be recognized on upstream bugs).

And in the meantime I am going to look about adding ..

.. late SWIOTLB expansion to stich the DMA pools together as both
Mellanox and VirtIO are not 32-bit DMA bound.
