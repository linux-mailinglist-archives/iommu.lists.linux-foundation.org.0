Implementing .iotlb_sync_map means that a single top-level 
iommu_map()/iommu_map_sg() call should still only invoke a single "TLB 
flush" (really, any maintenance required for the IOMMU to start using 
the new mapping) at the end, regardless of how many internal 
__iommu_map() calls are made to satisfy the overall request. If you're 
seeing something other than that behaviour (with this series), that 
implies we've not got things quite right yet.

FWIW the old __domain_mapping() code just did a dumb iteration over the 
scatterlist segments internally, so __iommu_map_sg() should be no worse 
in that regard, and could in principle even be better if it's able to 
coalesce things far enough to start fitting large page mappings. The 
only appreciable difference *should* be any additional self-time in 
__iommu_map() due to the iteration now being performed one layer up.

Is there any significant difference between how the NFS read and write 
paths make their DMA API calls and/or get their scatterlists in the 
first place, that might help shed some light on the curious 
half-recovery you got?

Thanks,
Robin.
