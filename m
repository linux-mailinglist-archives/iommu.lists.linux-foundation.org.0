For highmem and certain encryption setups, yes, but plain non-cacheable 
remaps like on arm64 could technically be done either way round.

Indeed the memset() itself will be faster, but a fair amount of that 
"saving" will just be punting work to arch_dma_prep_coherent() - 
ultimately the same number of bytes of zeros has to be pushed out into 
the memory system either way. It should certainly be somewhat more 
efficient in that any previously-dirty cache lines won't get written out 
twice, and background cache eviction allows a bit more overlap of 
operations, but I'm wondering how significant a difference it really is 
in practice.

Really, though, I'm thinking ahead to the remap-in-place idea using 
set_memory_*() or similar, and where that might fit into all this, as it 
seems to be about equal parts remap, set_uncached, and neither.

Robin.
