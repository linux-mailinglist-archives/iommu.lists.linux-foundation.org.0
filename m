So I was thinking about this topic again.. I would still like to get
some sort of async resume so that I can wire up GPU cmdstream/state
logging on iommu fault (without locally resurrecting and rebasing this
patch and drm/msm side changes each time I need to debug iommu
faults)..

And I do still prefer the fault cb in irq (or not requiring it in
wq)..  but on thinking about it, the two ideas aren't entirely
conflicting, ie. add some flags either when we register handler[1], or
they could be handled thru domain_set_attr, like:

 _EXPLICIT_RESUME - iommu API user calls iommu_domain_resume(),
potentialy from wq/thread after fault handler returns
 _HANDLER_SLEEPS  - iommu core handles the wq, and calls ops->resume()
internally

In both cases, from the iommu driver PoV it just implements
iommu_ops::resume().. in first case it is called via iommu user either
from the fault handler or at some point later (ie. wq or thread).

I don't particularly need the _HANDLER_SLEEPS case (unless I can't
convince anyone that iommu_domamin_resume() called from outside iommu
core is a good idea).. so probably I wouldn't wire up the wq plumbing
for the _HANDLER_SLEEPS case unless someone really wanted me to.

Since there are more iommu drivers, than places that register fault
handlers, I like the idea that in either case, from the driver PoV, it
is just implementing the resume callback.

[1] currently I only see a few places where fault handlers are
registered, so changing iommu_set_fault_handler() is really not much
churn
