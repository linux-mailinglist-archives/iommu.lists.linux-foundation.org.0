Yeah. One shot should prevent most of the wreckage. I just wanted to
spell it out.

TBH, that's insane. You clearly want to think about this some more. If
you swap out device state and device control state then you definitly
want to have regions which are read only from the device POV and never
written back. The MSI msg store clearly belongs into that category.
But that's not restricted to the MSI msg store, there is certainly other
stuff which never wants to be written back by the device.

If you don't do that then you simply can't write to that space from the
CPU and you have to transport this kind information always via command
queues.

But that does not make sense. It's trivial enough to have

    | RO state |
    | RW state |

and on swap in the whole thing is DMA'd into the device and on swap out
only the RW state part. It's not rocket science and makes a huge amount
of sense.

That's clear, but with a proper seperation like the above and some extra
mechanism which allows you to tickle a relaod of 'RO state' you can
avoid quite some of the problems which you create otherwise.

Kinda. That needs a lot of thought for the affinity setting stuff
because it can be called from contexts which do not allow that. It's
solvable though, but I clearly need to stare at the corner cases for a
while.

No. ARM64 has that as well.

IIRC, yes.

I disagree :)

Async is fine in any variant (except for hotplug). Though having an
async WQ or whatever there needs some thought.

It's used to avoid irq chip (often MMIO) access in scenarios where
disable/enable of an interrupt line happens with high frequency. Serial
has that issue. So we mark it disabled, but do not mask it and the core
can handle that and masks it once an interrupt comes in in masked
state. That obviously does not work out of the box to protect against
not disabled but masked state, but conceptually it's a similar problem
and can be made work without massive changes. 

OTOH, in normal operation for MSI interrupts (edge type) masking is not
used at all and just restricted to the startup teardown.

But I clearly need to think about it with a more awake brain some more.

It's differently complicated and not less horrible :)
