That is nice. But past experience has shown that stop-gap arrangments
end up being the defacto solution.

Please rework the patch to:

 - Use a log solution instead of the multiplication.
   Feel free to cap it at a sensible value.

 - Also the code depends on SWIOTLB calling in to the
   adjust_swiotlb_default_size which looks wrong.

   You should not adjust io_tlb_nslabs from swiotlb_size_or_default.
   That function's purpose is to report a value.

 - Make io_tlb_nslabs be visible outside of the SWIOTLB code.

 - Can you utilize the IOMMU_INIT APIs and have your own detect which would
   modify the io_tlb_nslabs (and set swiotbl=1?).

   Actually you seem to be piggybacking on pci_swiotlb_detect_4gb - so
   perhaps add in this code ? Albeit it really should be in it's own
   file, not in arch/x86/kernel/pci-swiotlb.c

 - Tweak the code in the swiotlb code to make sure it can deal
   with io_tlb_nslabs being modified outside of the code at
   the start. It should have no trouble, but only testing will
   tell for sure.
