Hrm?  I think I'm saying the opposite of your "both not set
IOMMU_CACHE".  IOMMU_CACHE is the mapping flag that enables
DMA_PTE_SNP.  Maybe you're using IOMMU_CACHE as the state reported to
KVM?

It does not, we'll probably need a vfio ioctl to gratuitously announce
the KVM fd to each device.  I think some devices might currently fail
their open callback if that linkage isn't already available though, so
it's not clear when that should happen, ie. it can't currently be a
VFIO_DEVICE ioctl as getting the device fd requires an open, but this
proposal requires some availability of the vfio device fd without any
setup, so presumably that won't yet call the driver open callback.
Maybe that's part of the attach phase now... I'm not sure, it's not
clear when the vfio device uAPI starts being available in the process
of setting up the ioasid.  Thanks,

Alex
