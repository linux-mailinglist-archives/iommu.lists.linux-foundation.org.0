Even if we were to relax wbinvd access to any device (capable of
no-snoop or not) in any IOMMU configuration (blocking no-snoop or not),
I think as soon as we say "proof" is required to gain this access then
that proof should be ongoing for the life of the access.

That alone makes this more than a "I want this feature, here's my
proof", one-shot ioctl.  Like the groupfd enabling a path for KVM to
ask if that group is non-coherent and holding a group reference to
prevent the group from being used to authorize multiple KVM instances,
the ioasidfd proof would need to minimally validate that devices are
present and provide some reference to enforce that model as ongoing, or
notifier to indicate an end of that authorization.  I don't think we
can simplify that out of the equation or we've essentially invalidated
that the proof is really required.

That seems like a good model, use the kvm-vfio device for the default
behavior and extend an existing KVM ioctl if QEMU still needs a way to
tell KVM to assume all DMA is coherent, regardless of what the kvm-vfio
device reports.

If feels like we should be able to support a backwards compatibility
mode using the vfio group, but I expect long term we'll want to
transition the kvm-vfio device from a groupfd to an ioasidfd.

If we create the IOMMU vs device coherency matrix:

            \ Device supports
IOMMU blocks \   no-snoop
  no-snoop    \  yes | no  |
---------------+-----+-----+
           yes |  1  |  2  |
---------------+-----+-----+
           no  |  3  |  4  |
---------------+-----+-----+

DMA is always coherent in boxes {1,2,4} (wbinvd emulation is not
needed).  VFIO will currently always configure the IOMMU for {1,2} when
the feature is supported.  Boxes {3,4} are where we'll currently
emulate wbinvd.  The best we could do, not knowing the guest or
insights into the guest driver would be to only emulate wbinvd for {3}.

The majority of devices appear to report no-snoop support {1,3}, but
the claim is that it's mostly unused outside of GPUs, effectively {2,4}.
I'll speculate that most IOMMUs support enforcing coherency (amd, arm,
fsl unconditionally, intel conditionally) {1,2}.

I think that means we're currently operating primarily in Box {1},
which does not seem to lean towards unconditional wbinvd access with
device ownership.

I think we have a desire with IOASID to allow user policy to operate
certain devices in {3} and I think the argument there is that a
specific software enforced coherence sync is more efficient on the bus
than the constant coherence enforcement by the IOMMU.

I think that the disable mode Jason proposed is essentially just a way
to move a device from {3} to {4}, ie. the IOASID support or
configuration does not block no-snoop and the device claims to support
no-snoop, but doesn't use it.  How we'd determine this to be true for
a device without a crystal ball of driver development or hardware
errata that no-snoop transactions are not possible regardless of the
behavior of the enable bit, I'm not sure.  If we're operating a device
in {3}, but the device does not generate no-snoop transactions, then
presumably the guest driver isn't generating wbinvd instructions for us
to emulate, so where are the wbinvd instructions that this feature
would prevent being emulated coming from?  Thanks,

Alex
