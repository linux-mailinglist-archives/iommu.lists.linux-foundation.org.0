Heh, no worries - it's not like you were even CC'ed on the thread where 
I only mentioned I *might* do it.

Can I get away with being cheeky and just saying that my review comments 
are the diff between my branch and yours, I wonder...

Yup, it's a mistake in the TRM. I just checked a real MMU-600 and the 
PMU PIDRs match the main TCU/TBU PIDRs as expected. At least the MMU-700 
docs haven't repeated the same error.

Cheers,
Robin.
