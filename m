I guess we may do vSVA for PF first, and then adding VF vSVA later
given above additional need. It's not necessarily to enable both
in one step.

Is there vendor guarantee that hidden registers will locate at the
same offset between PF and VF config space?

Then what would be a viable option? Vendor nasty habit implies
no standard, thus I don't see how VFIO can find a safe location
by itself. Also curious how those hidden registers are identified
by VFIO and employed with proper r/w policy today. If sort of quirks
are used, then could such quirk way be extended to also carry
the information about vendor specific safe location? When no
such quirk info is provided (the majority case), VFIO then finds
out a free location to carry the new cap.

Thanks
Kevin
