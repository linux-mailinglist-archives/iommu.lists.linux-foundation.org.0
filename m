Part of the problem is that we need some way for the driver to know if
the connected device is external or not.  A soldered-down storage
device connected via an internal PCIe bus is probably OK to use w/
non-strict.  An exposed PCIe port that anyone could plug anything into
is probably not OK to use with non-strict.  Right now the kernel
doesn't have this info.

Part of the problem is also trying to describe the risk level that
you're OK with and/or which risks you're willing to take and which
ones you're not willing to take.  Right now there's a binary: "accept
all the risk so I can get the best performance" and "accept none of
the risk".  ...but what if you want to accept some risks and not
others?  Maybe you're compiling the firmware for the video decoder
yourself and you're very convinced that it really sanitizes all input
and can't be compromised (or, if it is, you can quickly patch the
compromise).  You might be willing to run this video codec in "non
strict mode".  ...but if you give the video decoder firmware to
someone else as a binary blob they might not be willing to trust you
and might want to run the same firmware as "non-strict".
