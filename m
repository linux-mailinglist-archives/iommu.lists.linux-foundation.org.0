You are right. This is also my understanding of an "isolation group".

But, as I understand it, iommu_group is only the isolation group visible
to IOMMU. When we talk about sub-devices (sw-mdev or mdev w/ pasid),
only the device and device driver knows the details of isolation, hence
iommu_group could not be extended to cover them. The device drivers
should define their own isolation groups.

Otherwise, the device driver has to fake an iommu_group and add hacky
code to link the related IOMMU elements (iommu device, domain, group
etc.) together. Actually this is part of the problem that this proposal
tries to solve.

If we understand it as multiple levels of isolation, can we classify the
devices into the following categories?

1) Legacy devices
    - devices without device-level isolation
    - multiple devices could sit in a single iommu_group
    - only a single I/O address space could be bound to IOMMU

2) Modern devices
    - devices capable of device-level isolation
    - able to have subdevices
    - self-isolated, hence not share iommu_group with others
    - multiple I/O address spaces could be bound to IOMMU

For 1), all devices in an iommu_group should be bound to a single
IOASID; The isolation is guaranteed by an iommu_group.

For 2) a single device could be bound to multiple IOASIDs with each sub-
device corresponding to an IOASID. The isolation of each subdevice is
guaranteed by the device driver.

Best regards,
baolu
