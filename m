Hi Sven,

I don't think the first option is going to work for PCIe.  PCIe
devices will have to use "iommu-map" properties to map PCI devices to
the right iommu, and the currently implementation seems to assume that
#iommu-cells = <1>.  The devictree binding[1] doesn't explicitly state
that it relies on #iommu-cells = <1>, but it isn't clear how the
rid-base to iommu-base mapping mechanism would work when that isn't
the case.

Now the PCIe DARTs are simpler and seem to have only one "instance"
per DART.  So if we keep #iommu-cells = <1> for those, you'd still be
fine using the first approach.

As I mentioned before, not all DARTs support the full 32-bit aperture.
In particular the PCIe DARTs support a smaller address-space.  It is
not clear whether this is a restriction of the PCIe host controller or
the DART, but the Apple Device Tree has "vm-base" and "vm-size"
properties that encode the base address and size of the aperture.
These single-cell properties which is probably why for the USB DARTs
only "vm-base" is given; since "vm-base" is 0, a 32-bit number
wouldn't be able to encode the full aperture size.  We could make them
64-bit numbers in the Linux device tree though and always be explicit
about the size.  Older Sun SPARC machines used a single "virtual-dma"
property to encode the aperture.  We could do someting similar.  You
would use this property to initialize domain->geometry.aperture_start
and domain->geometry.aperture_end in diff 3/3 of this series.

I think it would make sense to include this in this series, as this
would make adding support for PCIe very easy, and PCIe gives you
aupport for network (both wired and wireless) and the type-A USB ports
on the mini.

Cheers,

Mark
