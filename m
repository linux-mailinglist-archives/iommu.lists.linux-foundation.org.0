This seems like a misunderstanding of groups.  Groups are not tied to
any PCI meaning.  Groups are the smallest unit of isolation, no matter
what is providing that isolation.

If mdevs are isolated from each other by clever software, even though
they're on the same PCI device they are in different groups from each
other *by definition*.  They are also in a different group from their
parent device (however the mdevs only exist when mdev driver is
active, which implies that the parent device's group is owned by the
kernel).

That doesn't necessarily follow.  mdevs which can be successfully
isolated by their mdev driver are in a different group from their
parent device, and therefore need not be affected by whether the
parent device shares a group with some other physical device.  They
*might* be, but that's up to the mdev driver to determine based on
what it can safely isolate.
