Unfortunately, even just looking at devices across a couple laptops
most devices do support and have NoSnoop+ set by default.  I don't
notice anything in the kernel that actually tries to set this enable (a
handful that actively disable), so I assume it's done by the firmware.
It's not safe for QEMU to make an assumption that only GPUs will
actually make use of it.

It's currently just a matter of the kvm-vfio device holding a reference
to the group so that it cannot be used elsewhere so long as it's being
used to elevate privileges on a given KVM instance.  If we conclude that
access to a device with the right capability is required to gain a
privilege, I don't really see how we can wave aside that the privilege
isn't lost with the device.

Yes, QEMU can reject a hot-unplug event, but then QEMU retains the
privilege that the device grants it.  Releasing the device and
retaining the privileged gained by it seems wrong.  Thanks,

Alex
