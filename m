That might be where we differ.  As I've said, my group I'm primarily
meaning the fundamental hardware unit of isolation.  *Usually* that's
determined by the capabilities of an IOMMU, but in some cases it might
not be.  In either case, the boundaries still matter.

Yes, in that case the mdev absolutely should be in the VF's group -
having its own group is not just messy but incorrect.

But.. the case of multiple mdevs managed by a single PCI device with
an internal IOMMU also exists, and then the mdev groups are *not*
proxies but true groups independent of the parent device.  Which means
that the group structure of mdevs can vary, which is an argument *for*
keeping it, not against.

Is it, though?  Again, I'm talking about the case of multiple mdevs
with a single parent device (because that's the only case I was aware
of until recently).  Isolation comes from a device-internal
IOMMU... that turns out to be broken.  But if your security domain
happens to include all the mdevs on the device anyway, then you don't
care.

Are you really going to say people can't use their fancy hardware in
this mode because it has a security flaw that's not relevant to their
usecase?


And then.. there's Kirti's case.  In that case the mdev should belong
to its parent PCI device's group since that's what's providing
isolation.  But in that case the parent device can be in a
multi-device group for any of the usual reasons (PCIe-to-PCI bridge,
PCIe switch with broken ACS, multifunction device with crosstalk).
Which means the mdev also shares a group with those other device.  So
again, the group structure matters and is not a fiction.
