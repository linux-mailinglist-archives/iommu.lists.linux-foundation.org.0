I like the concept of a branch per driver, because with that I can just
exclude that branch from my next-merge when there are issues with it.
Conflicts between branches happen too, but they are quite manageable
when the branches have the same base.

Overall I am thinking of reorganizing the IOMMU tree, but it will likely
not end up to be a single-branch tree, although the number of patches
per cycle _could_ just be carried in a single branch.

Yeah, so it is 4 weeks in an 9 weeks cycle :) The merge window is 2
weeks and not a lot happens. The 2 weeks after are for stabilization and
I usually only pick up fixes. Then come the 4 weeks were new code gets
into the tree. In the last week everything gets testing in linux-next to
be ready for the merge window. I will pickup fixes in that week, of
course.

Sure, I can put these patches in a separate branch for Alex to pull into
the VFIO tree.
