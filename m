Ah, sorry, I did indeed fail the reading comprehension test - too many 
levels of indirection...

On second reading I agree that this probably should work out OK (other 
than perhaps a performance hit from chaining more indirect branches). 
I've noted on my to-do list to come back and clean up arm_smmu_flush_ops 
for next cycle, but for now I'll get back to the more pressing matters.

Thanks,
Robin.
