Right, I think it's fair to draw a line and say that anyone who wants a 
*specific* address needs to manage their own IOMMU domain.

In the backend I suspect it's going to be cleanest to implement a 
dedicated iova_alloc_low() (or similar) function in the IOVA API that 
sidesteps all of the existing allocation paths and goes straight to the 
rbtree.

Robin.
