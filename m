Christoph,

	Since we have not heard back from you, I am not sure where you
	stand on this issue now.   One of the three things are
	possible..

	(a) our above explaination did not make sense and hence
		you decided to ignore it.
	(b) our above above made some sense and need more time to think 
		and respond.
	(c) you totally forgot about this.


I hope it is (b). We want a solution that works for all, and your inputs 
are important to us.


Thanks,
RP
