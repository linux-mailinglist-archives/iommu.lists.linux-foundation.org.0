Right... so this would be a lot easier to deal with using that earlier
proposal where the IOMMU regions were a separate thing and referencing
the reserved-memory nodes. In those cases we could just have the
physical reservation for the framebuffer once (so we don't get any
duplicates or overlaps) and then have each IOVA reservation reference
that to create the mapping.

Perhaps this needs to be a bit more verbose then. If we want the ability
to create a mapping for only a partial reservation, I could imagine we
may as well want one that doesn't start at the beginning. So perhaps an
ever better solution would be to have a complete mapping, something that
works similar to "ranges" perhaps, like so:

	fb@80000000 {
		reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
		iommu-ranges =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000 0x80000000>;
	};

That would be for a full identity mapping, but we could also have
something along the lines of this:

	fb@80000000 {
		reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
		iommu-ranges =3D <0x80100000 0x00100000 0xa0000000>;
	};

So that would only map a 1 MiB chunk at offset 1 MiB (of the physical
reservation) to I/O virtual address 0xa0000000.

The earlier "separate iov-reserved-memory" proposal would be a good
compromise here. It'd allow us to duplicate only the necessary bits
(i.e. the IOVA mappings) but keep the common bits simple. And even
the IOVA mappings could be shared for cases like identity mappings.
See below for more on that.

One other benefit of the separate iov-reserved-memory node would be that
the iommus property could be simplified. If we have a physical
reservation that needs to be accessed by multiple different display
controllers, we'd end up with something fairly complex, such as this:

	fb: fb@80000000 {
		reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
		iommus =3D <&dc0_iommu 0xa0000000 0x01000000>,
			 <&dc1_iommu 0xb0000000 0x01000000>,
			 <&dc2_iommu 0xc0000000 0x01000000>;
	};

This would get even worse if we want to support partial mappings. Also,
it'd become quite complicated to correlate this with the memory-region
references:

	dc0: dc@40000000 {
		...
		memory-region =3D <&fb>;
		iommus =3D <&dc0_iommu>;
		...
	};

So now you have to go match up the phandle (and potentially specifier)
in the iommus property of the disp0 node with an entry in the fb node's
iommus property. That's all fairly complicated stuff.

With separate iov-reserved-memory, this would be a bit more verbose, but
each individual node would be simpler:

	reserved-memory {
		fb: fb@80000000 {
			reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
		};
	};

	iov-reserved-memory {
		fb0: fb@80000000 {
			/* identity mapping, "reg" optional? */
			reg =3D <0x80000000 0x01000000>;
			memory-region =3D <&fb>;
		};

		fb1: fb@90000000 {
			/* but doesn't have to be */
			reg =3D <0x90000000 0x01000000>;
			memory-region =3D <&fb>;
		};

		fb2: fb@a0000000 {
			/* can be partial, too */
			ranges =3D <0x80000000 0x00800000 0xa0000000>;
			memory-region =3D <&fb>;
		};
	}

	dc0: dc@40000000 {
		iov-memory-regions =3D <&fb0>;
		/* optional? */
		memory-region =3D <&fb>;
		iommus =3D <&dc0_iommu>;
	};

Alternatively, if we want to support partial mappings, we could replace
those reg properties by ranges properties that I showed earlier. We may
even want to support both. Use "reg" for virtual-only reservations and
identity mappings, or "simple partial mappings" (that map a sub-region
starting from the beginning). Identity mappings could still be
simplified by just omitting the "reg" property. For more complicated
mappings, such as the ones on M1, the "ranges" property could be used.

Note how this looks a bit boilerplate-y, but it's actually really quite
simple to understand, even for humans, I think.

Also, the phandles in this are comparatively easy to wire up because
they can all be generated in a hierarchical way: generate physical
reservation and store phandle, then generate I/O virtual reservation
to reference that phandle and store the new phandle as well. Finally,
wire this up to the display controller (using either the IOV phandle or
both).

Granted, this requires the addition of a new top-level node, but given
how expressive this becomes, I think it might be worth a second
consideration.
