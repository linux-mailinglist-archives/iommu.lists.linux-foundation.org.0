As discussed earlier, the I/O page fault and cache invalidation paths
will have "device labels" so that the information could be easily
translated and routed.

So it's likely the per-device fault handler registering API in iommu
core can be kept, but /dev/ioasid will be grown with a layer to
translate and propagate I/O page fault information to the right
consumers.

If things evolve in this way, probably the SVA I/O page fault also needs
to be ported to /dev/ioasid.
