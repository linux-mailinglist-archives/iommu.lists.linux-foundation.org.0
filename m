We'll try making some noise again internally and see where that goes, 
but given the progress over the last 4 years I'd be inclined to posit a 
new theory of the universe eventually ending in one giant event 0x10.

I don't think so - getting the information from the PCI layer to the 
IOMMU layer at the right place and time to influence the default domain 
choice would seemingly need some uglier and even less popular 
infrastructure adding. It's something that only the IOMMU layer has any 
need to be aware of, and the def_domain_type callback essentially exists 
for this kind of special-casing - compare intel-iommu's 
device_def_domain_type() for example. If we accept a workaround at all, 
I do believe this is the least-worst option.

Robin.
