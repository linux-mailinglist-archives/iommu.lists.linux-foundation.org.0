Coherency possibly.

There's a possible coherency issue at the compare depending on the
IOMMU capabilities which could affect whether DMA is coherent to memory
or requires an explicit flush.  I'm a little suspicious whether dmar0
is really the IOMMU controlling this device since you mention a 39bit
IOVA space, which is more typical of Intel client platforms which can
also have integrated graphics which often have a dedicated IOMMU at
dmar0 that isn't necessarily representative of the other IOMMUs in the
system, especially with regard to snoop-control.  Each dmar lists the
managed devices under it in sysfs to verify.  Support for snoop-control
would be identified in the ecap register rather than the cap register.
VFIO can also report coherency via the VFIO_DMA_CC_IOMMU extension
reported by VFIO_CHECK_EXTENSION ioctl.

However, CPU coherency might lead to a miscompare, but not necessarily a
miscompare matching the previous iteration.  Still, for completeness
let's make sure this isn't a gap in the test programming making invalid
assumptions about CPU/DMA coherency.

The fact that randomizing the IOVA provides a workaround though might
suggest something relative to the IOMMU page table coherency.  But for
the new mmap target to have the data from the previous iteration, the
IOMMU PTE would need to be stale on read, but correct on write in order
to land back in your new mmap.  That seems peculiar.  Are we sure the
FPGA device isn't caching the value at the IOVA or using any sort of
IOTLB caching such as ATS that might not be working correctly?

I don't know that there's enough information here to make any
conclusions.  Here are some further questions:

 * What size mappings are being used, both for the mmap and the VFIO
   MAP/UNMAP operations.

 * If the above is venturing into super page support (2MB), does the
   vfio_iommu_type1 module option disable_hugepages=1 affect the
   results.

 * Along the same lines, does the kernel command line option
   intel_iommu=sp_off produce different results.

 * Does this behavior also occur on upstream kernels (ie. v5.17)?

 * Do additional CPU cache flushes in the test program produce different
   results?

 * Is this a consumer available FPGA device that others might be able
   to reproduce this issue?  I've always wanted such a device for
   testing, but also we can't rule out that the FPGA itself or its
   programming is the source of the miscompare.

From the vfio perspective, UNMAP_DMA should first unmap the pages at
the IOMMU to prevent device access before unpinning the pages.  We do
make use of batch unmapping to reduce iotlb flushing, but the result is
expected to be that the IOMMU PTE entries are invalidated before the
UNMAP_DMA operation completes.  A stale IOVA would not be expected or
correct operation.  Thanks,

Alex
