OK, so apparently the hardware is not quite as trivial as my initial 
impression, and you should have interrupts as well.

Having stumbled across the DRM driver patches the other day, I now see 
where this is coming from, and it's even worse than that - this whole 
binding seems to be largely working around bad driver design.

In fact judging by the other driver it looks like the length only needs 
to be 0x200 here (but maybe there's more to come in future).

...and this one looks to need less than 0x80, even :)

FWIW that's really a very different situation - the MMUs in a Mali GPU 
are fundamental parts of its internal pipelines and would never make 
sense to handle as separate devices (if it were even feasible to try). 
An IOMMU like this one is typically a logically-distinct block stuck to 
the external bus interface of any old device, rewriting transactions 
that said device has already issued - it's telling that it needs to 
allocate the prot_page scratchpad for "faulting" transactions to still 
flow somewhere, implying that it's not even involved enough to be able 
to terminate them.

As such I think it *does* make complete sense to describe even 
"dedicated" IOMMUs like this one, Rockchip, Exynos, etc. in DT. 
Otherwise you'd be effectively forcing OSes to turn half their 
display/media drivers into mini board files with secret knowledge of 
which blocks are integrated with IOMMUs on which SoCs.

Robin.
