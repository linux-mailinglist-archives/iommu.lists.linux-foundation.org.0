Let me add some context to this whole patch series. The pressure on
the core PMU counters
is increasing as more people want to use them to measure always more
events. When the PMU
is overcommitted, i.e., more events than counters for them, there is
multiplexing. It comes
with an overhead that is too high for certain applications. One way to
avoid this is to lower the
multiplexing frequency, which is by default 1ms, but that comes with
loss of accuracy. Another approach is
to measure only a small number of events at a time and use multiple
runs, but then you lose consistent event
view. Another approach is to push for increasing the number of
counters. But getting new hardware
counters takes time. Short term, we can investigate what it would take
to free one cycle-capable
counter which is commandeered by the hard lockup detector on all X86
processors today. The functionality
of the watchdog, being able to get a crash dump on kernel deadlocks,
is important and we cannot simply
disable it. At scale, many bugs are exposed and thus machines
deadlock. Therefore, we want to investigate
what it would take to move the detector to another NMI-capable source,
such as the HPET because the
detector does not need high low granularity timer and interrupts only every 2s.

Furthermore, recent Intel erratum, e.g., the TSX issue forcing the TFA
code in perf_events, have increased the pressure
even more with only 3 generic counters left. Thus, it is time to look
at alternative ways of  getting a hard lockup detector
(NMI watchdog) from another NMI source than the PMU. To that extent, I
have been discussing about alternatives.
Intel suggested using the HPET and Ricardo has been working on
producing this patch series. It is clear from your review
that the patches have issues, but I am hoping that they can be
resolved with constructive feedback knowing what the end goal is.

As for the round-robin changes, yes, we discussed this as an
alternative to avoid overloading CPU0 with handling
all of the work to broadcasting IPI to 100+ other CPUs.

Thanks.
