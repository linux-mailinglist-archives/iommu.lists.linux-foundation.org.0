My mistake, in fact it's already just as broken either way - I forgot 
that that's done implicitly via iovad->start_pfn rather than an actual 
reserve_iova() entry. I see there is an initial calculation attempting 
to honour start_pfn in patch #3, but it's always immediately 
overwritten. More critically, the rb_first()/rb_next walk means the 
starting point can only creep inevitably upwards as older allocations 
are freed, so will end up pathologically stuck at or above limit_pfn and 
unable to recover. At best it's more "next-fit" than "first-fit", and 
TBH the fact that it could ever even allocate anything at all in an 
empty domain makes me want to change the definition of IOVA_ANCHOR ;)

I still understand the use-case; I object to a solution where PFN 0 is 
always reserved yet sometimes allocated. Not to mention the slightly 
more fundamental thing of the whole lot not actually working the way 
it's supposed to.

I also remain opposed to baking in secret ABIs where allocators are 
expected to honour a particular undocumented behaviour. FWIW I've had 
plans for a while now to make the IOVA walk bidirectional to make the 
existing retry case more efficient, at which point it's then almost 
trivial to implement "bottom-up" allocation, which I'm thinking I might 
then force on by default for CONFIG_ARM to minimise any further 
surprises for v2 of the default domain conversion. However I'm 
increasingly less convinced that it's really sufficient for your case, 
and am leaning back towards the opinion that any driver with really 
specific constraints on how its DMA addresses are laid out should not be 
passively relying on a generic allocator to do exactly what it wants. A 
simple flag saying "try to allocate DMA addresses bottom-up" doesn't 
actually mean "allocate this thing on a 256MB-aligned address and 
everything subsequent within a 256MB window above it", so let's not 
build a fragile house of cards on top of pretending that it does.

Because it's the most convenient and efficient thing to do. Remember we 
tried to use 0 for DMA_MAPPING_ERROR too, but that turned out to be a 
usable physical RAM address on some systems. With a virtual address 
space, on the other hand, we're free to do whatever we want; that's kind 
of the point.

Thanks,
Robin.
