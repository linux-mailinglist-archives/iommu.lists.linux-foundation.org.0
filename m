Thanks, that makes a lot of sense.

I'm still a bit unsure as of what to do exactly here. I haven't found
a hook that would be called when a given domain doesn't have any
devices attached to it. Or did you mean that I should just create a
separate function, not part of the IOMMU ops?

That's a good point :)

I'll look into it, thanks!

I don't have any idea on how it's going to evolve, and the latter
seems cleaner, I'll work on that.

Going further off-topic, why do we need a remap instead of a regular
physical address?

Thanks!
