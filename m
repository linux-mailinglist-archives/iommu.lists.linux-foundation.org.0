So you are just forcing the driver to manage this all on their own, so
how about, "driver_managed_dma", or even shorter "managed_dma"?

See above, you want a driver author to know instantly what this is and
not have to look anything up.
"I_will_manage_the_dma_myself_as_I_really_know_what_I_am_doing" might be
good, but a bit too long :)
