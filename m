Most iommu vendor drivers have switched from per-device to per-group
domain (a.k.a. default domain). So per-group pass-through mode makes
more sense?

By the way, can we extend this to "per-group default domain type",
instead of only "per-group pass-through mode"? Currently we have system
level default domain type, if we have finer granularity of default
domain type, both iommu drivers and end users will benefit from it.

Just out of curiosity, what's the limitation for a device using pass-
through DMA domain to be assignable.
