per device and per PASID. you may have a look from the below arch. PASID
table is per device, the binding of page table are set to PASID table
entry.

"
In VT-d implementation, PASID table is per device and maintained in the host.
Guest PASID table is shadowed in VMM where virtual IOMMU is emulated.

    .-------------.  .---------------------------.
    |   vIOMMU    |  | Guest process CR3, FL only|

for L2 page table mappings, it's done by VFIO MAP/UNMAP. for vdpa, I guess
it is tlb flush. so you are right. Keeping L1/L2 page table management in
a single uAPI set is also a reason for my current series which extends VFIO
for L1 management.
