It might be worth printing this default value always and not just for 
when it is set from commandline, like what we do for default domain type 
and IOTLB invalidation policy

Do we have a strategy for if and when issues start popping up on other 
architectures? Is it to simply tell them to just turn this flag on (and 
also fix your platform)?
