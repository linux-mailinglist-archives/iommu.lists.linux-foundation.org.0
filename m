Some of this seems out of date. Pretty sure the pages are not refcounted
with vmf_insert_mixed() and vmf_insert_mixed() is currently the only way
to use VM_MIXEDMAP mappings.

Sure but if you look at other vmf_insert_mixed() (of which there are
few) you see similar patterns. Seems more like it was documented with
one thing in mind but then used in a completely different manner. Which
is why I suggested the documentation was not so good.
