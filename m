Ok so from what I gather from this is that its not easy to test for the
negative impact and you don't have data on such yet and the behaviour is
very vendor specific. To add on qcom impl, we have several performance
improvements for TLB cache invalidations in HW like wait-for-safe(for 
realtime
clients such as camera and display) and few others to allow for cache
lookups/updates when TLBI is in progress for the same context bank, so 
atleast
we are good here.

Ok since you are interested in camera usecase, I have requested for more 
details
from the camera team and will give it once they comeback. However I 
don't think
its good to have unmap latency at all and that is being addressed by 
this patch.

This patch is to optimize unmap latency because of large number of mmio 
writes(TLBIVAs)
wasting CPU cycles and not to fix camera issue which can probably be 
solved by
parallelization. It seems to me like you are ok with the unmap latency 
in general
which we are not and want to avoid that latency.

Hi @Robin, from these discussions it seems they are not ok with the 
change
for all SoC vendor implementations and do not have any data on such 
impact.
As I mentioned above, on QCOM platforms we do have several optimizations 
in HW
for TLBIs and would like to make use of it and reduce the unmap latency.
What do you think, should this be made implementation specific?

Thanks,
Sai
