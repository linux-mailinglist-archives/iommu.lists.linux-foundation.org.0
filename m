This patchset adds IMP DEF event support for the SMMUv3 PMCG.

It is marked as an RFC as the method to identify the PMCG implementation
may be a quite disliked. And, in general, the series is somewhat
incomplete.

So the background is that the PMCG supports IMP DEF events, yet we have no
method to identify the PMCG to know the IMP DEF events.

A method for identifying the PMCG implementation could be using
PMDEVARCH, but we cannot rely on this being set properly, as whether this
is implemented is not defined in SMMUv3 spec.

Another method would be perf event aliasing, but this method of event
matching is based on CPU id, which would not guarantee same
uniqueness as PMCG implementation.

Yet another method could be to continue using ACPI OEM ID in the IORT
code, but this does not scale. And it is not suitable if we ever add DT
support to the PMCG driver.

The method used in this series is based on matching on the parent SMMUv3
IIDR. We store this IIDR contents in the arm smmu structure as the first
element, which means that we don't have to expose SMMU APIs - this is
the part which may be disliked.

The final two patches switch the pre-existing PMCG model identification
from ACPI OEM ID to the same parent SMMUv3 IIDR matching.

For now, we only consider SMMUv3' nodes being the associated node for
PMCG.

John Garry (6):
  ACPI/IORT: Set PMCG device parent
  iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Record IIDR in arm_smmu_device structure
  perf/smmuv3: Retrieve parent SMMUv3 IIDR
  perf/smmuv3: Support HiSilicon hip08 (hi1620) IMP DEF events
  perf/smmuv3: Match implementation options based on parent SMMU IIDR
  ACPI/IORT: Drop code to set the PMCG software-defined model
