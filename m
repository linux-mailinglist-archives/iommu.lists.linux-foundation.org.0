This doesn't make much sense to me.  The previous patch indicates
there's work to be done in updating the kvm-vfio contract to understand
DMA coherency, so you're trying to limit use cases to those where the
IOMMU enforces coherency, but there's QEMU work to be done to support
the iommufd uAPI at all.  Isn't part of that work to understand how KVM
will be told about non-coherent devices rather than "meh, skip it in the
kernel"?  Also let's not forget that vfio is not only for KVM.

Couldn't the same argument be made that registering a $bus device as an
iommufd device is a common interface that shouldn't be the
responsibility of the vfio device driver?  Is userspace opening the
non-group device anything more than a reservation of that device if
access is withheld until iommu isolation?  I also don't really want to
predict how ioctls might evolve to guess whether only blocking .read,
.write, and .mmap callbacks are sufficient.  Thanks,

Alex
