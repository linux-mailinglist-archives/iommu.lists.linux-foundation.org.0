We are speaking about PCIe spec, where people write it about 5 years ahead
and every vendor tries to massage their product behavior with vague
words like this..  :)

But honestly for any any RCiEP, or even integrated endpoints, there 
is no way to send them except up north. These aren't behind a RP.

I did check with couple folks who are part of the SIG, and seem to agree
that ACS treatment for RCiEP's doesn't mean much. 

I understand the language isn't strong, but it doesn't seem like ACS should
be a strong requirement for RCiEP's and reasonable to relax.

What are your thoughts? 

Cheers,
Ashok
