Ok, that works assuming we can advertise multiple windows.

Well, my assumption was that DPDK always wanted an IOVA window to
cover its hugepage buffer space.  So not "constant" exactly, but a
value it will know at start up time.  But I think we cover that more
closely below.

I doubt the difference is meaningful in the context of an emulated
guest, though.

Yeah, I'm a bit baffled by that, and I don't know the context.  Note
that there are at least two different very different users of the host
IOMMU backends in: one is for emulation of guest DMA (with or without
a vIOMMU).  In that case the details of the guest platform should let
qemu know the ranges.  There's also a VFIO based NVME backend; that
one's much more like a "normal" userspace driver, where it doesn't
care about the address ranges (because they're not guest visible).

Well... as long as nothing they've already mapped goes away.

Hm, ok, I guess that makes sense.
