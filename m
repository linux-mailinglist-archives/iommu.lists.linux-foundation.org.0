As it was suggested in this or the previous thread, I'm not keen on
limiting ZONE_DMA32 to the smalles RPi4 can cover, as the naming
implies this zone should cover 32-bit devices that can deal with a full
32-bit mask.

I think it may be better if we have both ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 on
arm64. ZONE_DMA would be based on the smallest dma-ranges as described
in the DT while DMA32 covers the first naturally aligned 4GB of RAM
(unchanged). When a smaller ZONE_DMA is not needed, it could be expanded
to cover what would normally be ZONE_DMA32 (or could we have ZONE_DMA as
0-bytes? I don't think GFP_DMA can still allocate memory in this case).

We'd probably have to define ARCH_ZONE_DMA_BITS for arm64 to something
smaller than 32-bit but sufficient to cover the known platforms like
RPi4 (the current 24 is too small, so maybe 30). AFAICT,
__dma_direct_optimal_gfp_mask() figures out whether GFP_DMA or GFP_DMA32
should be passed.
