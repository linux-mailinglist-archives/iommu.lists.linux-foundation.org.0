I can see why a tight security model is needed to stop
random devices having access to mamory that they should
not be able to access.  Now that PCIe devices can be plugged
into Thunderbolt ports on computers, nobody wants to repeat
the disaster that Firewire ports created for systems over
a decade ago.

But I'd like to challege the one-size-fits-all policy. There's
a big difference between a random device plugged into a port
(which may even lie about its VendorID/DeviceID) and a device
that is part of the CPU socket.

I'd like people to think of DSA as an extension to the instruction
set. It implements asynchronous instructions like "MEMFILL" and
"MEMCOPY". These can be limited in scope when executed in user
processes or guests. But when executed by the host OS ring0 code
they can have all the same access that ring0 code has when it
dereferences a pointer.
