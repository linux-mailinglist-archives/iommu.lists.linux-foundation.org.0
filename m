That is, however, still a trade-off between saving that one copy and
protection from the DMA tampering with the packet contents when the
kernel is reading them. Notice how the copy effectively makes a
snapshot of the contents, guaranteeing that the kernel has a
consistent view of the packet, which is not true if the DMA could
modify the buffer contents in the middle of CPU accesses.
