Hi Jason,

Thanks for the explanation, more comments/questions inline.

Sorry, I don't get this. Are you saying we have to hold a mmgrab()
between svm_bind/mmu_notifier_register and
svm_unbind/mmu_notifier_unregister?
Isn't the idea of mmu_notifier is to avoid holding the mm reference and
rely on the notifier to tell us when mm is going away?
It seems both Intel and AMD iommu drivers don't hold mmgrab after
mmu_notifier_register.

Do you mean mmdrop() is after FD release? If so, unbind is called in FD
release should take care of everything, i.e. stops DMA, clear PASID
context on IOMMU, flush PRS queue etc.

Enforcing unbind upon FD close might be a precarious path, perhaps that
is why we have to deal with out of order situation?

Yes, I guess mmu_notifier_get()/put() is new :)

We plan to remove this flag.
