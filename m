Cache-coherent devices are still very rare on 32-bit ARM.

Among the callers of dma_mmap_coherent(), almost all are in platform
specific device drivers that only ever run on noncoherent ARM SoCs,
which explains why nobody would have noticed problems.

There is also a difference in behavior between ARM and PowerPC
when dealing with mismatched cacheability attributes: If the same
page is mapped as both cached and uncached to, this may
cause silent undefined behavior on ARM, while PowerPC should
enter a checkstop as soon as it notices.
