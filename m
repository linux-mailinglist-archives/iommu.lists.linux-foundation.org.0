Function graph is able to do this specific thing while it is not good to support developers
to use BPF code to do various analysis in various fancy ways. Another disadvanrage of
functiongraph is that it will add the overhead of ftrace of child functions to the parent
function:
a()
{
	b();
	c();
}
b()
{
	d();
}
We have some overhead of ftrace for b(), c(), d(), and all overhead will be added into a(). That can makes
the execution time of a() much longer.

On the other hand, in my original plan, the tracepoints in smmu-v3 driver would not be only in the entry and
exit of this function, it would be in some other places like
before and after the step 1, lock contention
before and after the step 5, wait for the completion of cmd_sync

and some other critical code path which can help analyze the latency of arm-smmu-v3.

I was using the two tracepoints to start the discussion. It happens these two can somehow be implemented
by function graph.

It is a bit sad that only 6 people are caring about the function. Don't know where other
ARM64 server guys go :-)

It seems optprobes/kprobe and tracepoints will work side by side. They are not trying
to replace each other since they both have their own advantages and disadvantages.

If both you and Jean think optprobes is a good direction to go for arm64, I am happy to
start some feasibility study.
