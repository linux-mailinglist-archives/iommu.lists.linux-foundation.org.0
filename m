OK it should be very similar for all the affected SoCs.

OK. So where is the -EPROBE_DEFER supposed to happen without
driver_deferred_probe_check_state() then?

OK

Yes with the default with no specific kernel params so looks like
FW_DEVLINK_FLAGS_ON.

Yes

It's built in so I did not try these.

Hmm so I'm not seeing any supplier for the top level ocp device in
the booting case without your patches. I see the suppliers for the
ocp child device instances only.

Without your patches I see simple-pm-bus probe initially with
EPROBE_DEFER like I described earlier, and then simple-pm-bus probes
on the second try.

Tony
