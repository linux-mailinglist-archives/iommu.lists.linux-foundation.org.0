yes, as part of the PRQ. please see my explanation in the previous

I think though 128-byte is large enough for any future extension but
64B might be good enough and it is a cache line. PCI page request msg
is only 16B :)

VT-d currently uses one 4K page for PRQ, holds 128 records of PRQ
descriptors. This can grow to 16K entries per spec. That is per IOMMU.
The user fault queue here is per device. So we do have to be frugal
about it since it will support mdev at per PASID level at some point?

I have to look into Eric's patchset on how he handles queue full in the
producer. If we go with 128B size in iommu_fault and 4KB size queue
(32 entries as in your table), VT-d PRQ size of 128 entries can
potentially cause queue full. We have to handle this VFIO queue full
differently than the IOMMU queue full in that we only need to discard
PRQ for one device. (Whereas IOMMU queue full has to clear out all).

Anyway, I think 64B should be enough but 128B is fine too. We have to
deal with queue full anyway. But queue full is expensive so we should
try to avoid.
