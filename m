Yes.  I should have been more careful.

That said, I think "invalidate without writeback" is a really
dangerous operation (it can generate some *really* hard to debug
memory state), so on the whole I think you should always strive to
just do "flush-and-invalidate".

If the core has support for "invalidate clean cache lines only", then
that's possibly a good alternative.

Right, again, when I said "flush" I really should have said "invalidate".

See above: I'd *really* want to avoid a pure "invalidate cacheline"
model. The amount of debug issues that can cause is not worth it.

So please flush-and-invalidate, or invalidate-non-dirty, but not just
"invalidate".

Ugh. Do we actually have cases that do it? That sounds really odd for
a "sync" operation. It sounds very reasonable for _allocating_ DMA,
but for syncing I'm left scratching my head what the semantics would
be.

But yes, if we do and people come up with semantics for it, those
semantics should be clearly documented.

And if we don't - or people can't come up with semantics for it - we
should actively warn about it and not have some code that does odd
things that we don't know what they mean.

But it sounds like you agree with my analysis, just not with some of
my bad/incorrect word choices.
