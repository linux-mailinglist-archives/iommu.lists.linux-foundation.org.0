OK, I was thinking the dual-DART accommodation is already at least some 
of the way there, but I guess it's still tied to a single device's cfg. 
One upside to generalising further might be that the dual-DART case 
stops being particularly special :)

Not being able to physically share pagetables shouldn't be too big a 
deal, just a bit more work to sync iommu_map/iommu_unmap calls across 
all the relevant instances for the given domain.
