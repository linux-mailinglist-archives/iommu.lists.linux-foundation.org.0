I think this statement answers all your remaining questions ;)

I understand a big part of Jason's argument is that we shouldn't be in
the habit of creating duplicate interfaces, we should create one, well
designed interfaces to share among multiple subsystems.  As new users
have emerged, our solution needs to change to a common one rather than
a VFIO specific one.  The IOMMU uAPI provides an abstraction, but at
the wrong level, requiring userspace interfaces for each subsystem.

Luckily the IOMMU uAPI is not really exposed as an actual uAPI, but
that changes if we proceed to enable the interfaces to tunnel it
through VFIO.

The logical answer would therefore be that we don't make that
commitment to the IOMMU uAPI if we believe now that it's fundamentally
flawed.

Ideally this new /dev/ioasid interface, and making use of it as a VFIO
IOMMU backend, should replace type1.  Type1 will live on until that
interface gets to parity, at which point we may deprecate type1, but it
wouldn't make sense to continue to expand type1 in the same direction
as we intend /dev/ioasid to take over in the meantime, especially if it
means maintaining an otherwise dead uAPI.  Thanks,

Alex
