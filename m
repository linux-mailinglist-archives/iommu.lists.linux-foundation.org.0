The main thing drivers need to do for flush queue support is to actually 
implement the optimisations which make it worthwhile. It's up to 
individual drivers how much use they want to make of the 
iommu_iotlb_gather mechanism, and they're free to issue invalidations or 
even enforce their completion directly within their unmap callback if 
they so wish. In such cases, enabling a flush queue would do nothing but 
hurt performance and waste memory.

Yes, I can't remember if I ever mentioned it anywhere, but that is not 
an oversight. The sysfs interface is a bit of a specialist sport, and if 
a user really wants to go out of their way to bring up a flush queue 
which won't help performance, they can, and they can observe the 
zero-to-negative performance gain, and maybe learn not to bother again 
on that system. It's just not worth the additional complexity to try to 
save users from themselves.

Shhh... the main point of the arm-smmu legacy binding support is to do 
whatever the handful of people still using ancient AMD Seattle boards 
with original firmware need to do. Clearly they haven't been reassigning 
devices straight back from VFIO to a kernel driver for the last 
6-and-a-bit years since that's been broken, so I'm now discounting it as 
a supported legacy-binding-use-case. Don't give them ideas! ;)

Nah, we just need to actually finish introducing default domains. I'm OK 
to tackle the remaining SoC IOMMU drivers once my bus ops work meanders 
into the arch/arm iommu-dma conversion revival; it just needs people who 
understand s390 and fsl-pamu well enough to at least (presumably) bodge 
up enough IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY support to replicate their current 
"detached" behaviours and force CONFIG_IOMMU_DEFAULT_PASSTHROUGH on 
those architectures.

Cheers,
Robin.
