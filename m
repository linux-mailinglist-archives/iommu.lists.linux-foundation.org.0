Bjorn,

I jump in and help with any reports of issues with fw_devlink if I'm
cc'ed. Please feel free to add me and I'll help fix any issues you
have with fw_devlink=on.

Can you please add me to any email thread with the details? I'd be
happy to help.

First step is to make sure all the devices probe as with
fw_devlink=permissive. After that if you are still seeing issues, it's
generally timing issues in the driver. But if the actual timing issue
is identified (by you or whoever knows the driver seeing the issue),
then I can help with fixes or suggestions for fixes.

Again, please CC me on these threads and I'd be happy to help.

Might not be believable, but I'm hoping fw_devlink helps you meet this goal :)
