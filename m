Yes I was only wondering about normal PASID reclaim operations, in
unbind(). Agreed that for FLR we need to properly clean the queue, though
I do need to do more thinking about this.

Anyway, having a full priq drain in unbind() isn't harmful, just
unnecessary delay in my opinion. I'll drop these patches for now but
thanks for the discussion.

Thanks,
Jean
