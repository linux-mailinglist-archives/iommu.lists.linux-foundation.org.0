Ok, the guest has no control over it, as it see 2 separate pci devices and
thinks they are all different.

Only time when it can fail is during the bind operation. From guest
perspective a bind in vIOMMU just turns into a write to local table and a
invalidate will cause the host to update the real copy from the shadow.

There is no way to fail the bind? and Allocation of the PASID is also a
separate operation and has no clue how its going to be used in the guest.

When you mean SW mdev, is it the GPU like case where mdev is purely a SW
construct? or SIOV type where RID+PASID case?

Recoverable faults for guest needs to be sent to guest? A page-request from
mdev1 and from mdev2 will both look alike when the process is sharing it.

Do we have any isolation requirements here? its the same process. So if the
page-request it sent to guest and even if you report it for mdev1, after
the PRQ is resolved by guest, the request from mdev2 from the same guest
should simply work?
