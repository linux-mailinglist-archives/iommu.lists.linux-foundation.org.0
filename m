Yes that's correct. S1ContextPtr is the IPA of the L1 Context Descriptor
Table which is then indexed by substreamID.

in ARM terminology substreamID matches the PASID and this is what
indexes the L1 Context Descriptor Table.

In ARM nested mode the L1 Context Descriptor Table is fully managed by
the guest and the userspace only needs to trap its S1ContextPtr and pass
it to the host.

Yes that's exactly what is done currently. At config time the host must
trap guest STE changes (format and S1ContextPtr) and "incorporate" those
changes into the stage2 related STE information. The STE is owned by the
host kernel as it contains the stage2 information (S2TTB).

In
https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0070/latest
(ARM_IHI_0070_D_b_System_Memory_Management_Unit_Architecture_Specification.pdf)
Synthetic diagrams can be found in 3.3.2 StreamIDs to Context
Descriptors. They give the global view.

Note this series only coped with a single CD in the Context Descriptor
Table.

Thanks
