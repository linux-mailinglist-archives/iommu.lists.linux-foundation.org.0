How common is it to use a device a significant amount, then unbind its 
driver and not use it for long enough to care about? Off-hand I can't 
think of a particularly realistic use-case which looks like that - the 
closest I can imagine is unbinding a default kernel driver to replace it 
with VFIO, but I would expect the set of devices intended for assignment 
to be distinct from the set of devices used by the host itself, and thus 
the host driver wouldn't have actually done much to generate a lot of 
DMA mappings in that initial period. Is my expectation there wrong?

If there is such a case, how much memory does this actually save in 
practice? The theoretical worst-case should be roughly 4 * 128 * 6 * 
sizeof(struct iova) bytes per CPU, which is around 192KB assuming 
64-byte kmem cache alignment. However it seems rather unlikely in 
practice to have every possible cache entry of every size used, so if 
saving smaller amounts of memory is a concern wouldn't you also want to 
explicitly drain the flush queues (16KB per CPU) and maybe look at 
trying to reclaim the unused pagetable pages from the domain itself - 
that ~192KB worth of cached IOVAs represents ~32K pages worth of IOVA 
space, which for an implementation like io-pgtable-arm with the 4KB 
granule means ~256KB worth of non-leaf pagetables left behind.

I'm not against the idea of having a mechanism to "compact" an idle DMA 
domain if there are convincing numbers to back it up, but the actual 
implementation would need to be better than this as well - having the 
IOMMU core code poking directly into the internals of the iommu-dma 
abstraction is not the way to go, and exporting anything to modules, 
which the IOMU core is not, smells suspicious.

Robin.
