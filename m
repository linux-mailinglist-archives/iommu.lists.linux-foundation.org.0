It doesn't sound to me like implementing platform-specific workarounds
is a good long-term solution (especially since, according to Bjorn, they
aren't as trivial to implement as it sounds). And we already have all
the infrastructure in place to implement what you describe, so I don't
see why we shouldn't do that. This patchset uses standard device tree
bindings that were designed for exactly this kind of use-case.

So at least for device-tree based boot firmware can already describe
these pre-existing mappings. If something standard materializes for ACPI
eventually I'm sure we can find ways to integrate that into whatever we
come up with now for DT.

I think between Bjorn, John, Laurentiu and myself there's pretty broad
consensus (correct me if I'm wrong, guys) that solving this via reserved
memory regions is a good solution that works. So I think what's really
missing is feedback on whether the changes proposed here or Laurentiu's
updated proposal[0] are acceptable, and if not, what the preference is
for getting something equivalent upstream.

Just to highlight: the IOMMU framework already provides infrastructure
to create direct mappings (via iommu_get_resv_regions(), called from
iommu_create_device_direct_mappings()). I have patches that make use of
this on Tegra210 and earlier where a non-ARM SMMU is used and where the
IOMMU driver enables translations (and doesn't fault by default) only at
device attachment time. That works perfectly using reserved-memory
regions. Perhaps that infrastructure could be extended to cover the
kinds of early mappings that we're discussing here. On the other hand it
might be a bit premature at this point because the ARM SMMU is the only
device that currently needs this, as far as I can tell.
