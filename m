Assuming you mean the DPRC devices rather than the MC itself, then yes; 
in that sense it's exactly the same as how we treat 
dynamically-discovered PCI devices.

Wrong - last time I looked, what that firmware actually manages are 
*ICIDs* for the devices, not SMMU Stream IDs or GIC Device IDs; what 
DT/ACPI specifies is a translation from ICID to Stream ID/Device ID. The 
ICID is very much the requester/input ID for that translation. Yes, in 
practice the "translation" is effectively always a trivial identity 
mapping, but conceptually it most definitely exists. Yes, the subtlety 
is incredibly easy to overlook because it's basically drawing a 
distinction between one end of some wires vs. the other end, but it matters.

(and of course "trivial 1:1 translation" isn't even true in the case of 
SMMU Stream ID values, since IIRC they are really composed of 5 
different inputs, only one of which is (part of) the incoming ICID)

If it represents a unique ICID allocated to the MC itself, then sure, it 
simply goes through the mapping like anything else. Just like a PCI host 
bridge owns requester ID 0:0.0 and thus whatever Stream ID/Device ID 
that might map to.

If (for the sake of argument, because AIUI everything is an ICID in this 
particular case) it's some hard-wired thing that exists in Stream 
ID/Device ID space only, then it's a little trickier, but still in 
scope. In DT we have a lovely distinction between between "originating 
from the node" and "translated through the node", e.g. "msi-parent" vs. 
"msi-map"; IORT is not quite as clear-cut, but there are at least a few 
options. If the valid input ID space is smaller than 32 bits, then the 
"Named Component as bridge" binding could simply define special 
out-of-range values to represent IDs originating from the bridge itself, 
such that the NC driver knows what to do and from IORT's point of view 
everything is just a normal mapping. Alternatively there's already the 
example of SMMUv3 where we can have a mix of the normal mappings from 
Stream ID to Device ID for the upstream masters plus a single mapping 
for the SMMU's own Device ID - admittedly that depends on the additional 
SMMUv3-specific Device ID Mapping Index property, but if necessary it 
might be workable to have a de-facto interface for NCs that only 
considers single mappings when configuring the NC itself, and only 
considers normal mappings when configuring its children. Or maybe define 
a new mapping flag or NC property if there's a real need to specify such 
a situation unambiguously at the IORT level.

I won't speak for Lorenzo or claim we've agreed on an approach at all 
(not least because in all honesty we haven't really discussed it beyond 
these various email threads), but FWIW my vision is that ultimately the 
DT/ACPI code would expose a *_dma_configure() interface that takes an 
optional input ID, or (perhaps more likely) an explicit pair of 
interfaces for "configure this regular device" and "configure this 
device based on this 'host' device and this ID", and it becomes the bus 
code's responsibility to pass the right device(s) and deal with multiple 
IDs (i.e. for starters all the PCI alias stuff goes back to the PCI code 
where it really should be, rather than having multiple copies of magic 
PCI awareness deep down in DT/ACPI code).
