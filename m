Yes Robin. We do use 0xC000_0000 address to set the DMA mask in our driver.

If you remember any of such drivers can you please point the driver path ?

True, we have gone through most of the APIs and didn't find any way to match our
requirements with the existing DMA APIs

We manage the no-IOMMU or pass through cases using the reserved-memory.

Just want to understand more from you, on the new iommu_ops we suggested.
Shouldn't device have that flexibility to allocate IOVA as per it's requirement?
If you see our device as example, we need to have control on the
allocated IOVA region
based on where device is using this buffer.

If we have these callbacks in place, then the low level IOMMU driver
can implement and
manage such requests when needed.

If this can't be taken forward for some right reasons, then we will
definitely try to understand
on how to manage the IOMMU domain from our driver as per your suggestion
