I only meant confused because you suggested that such a change would
reduce checks in the leaf functions when in fact it's the opposite.

As a general rule, I'd agree with you. However, it's not good to blindly
follow the rule when there might be good reasons to do it differently.

In this case, the caller doesn't have PCI devices. The nvme fabrics code
has a number of block devices and an RDMA device. It doesn't even know
if these devices are backed by PCI devices and it doesn't have a direct
path to obtain the pci_dev.

Each struct device, might be turned into a pci_dev using the static
function find_parent_pci_dev(). If any device is not a PCI device then
we reject the P2PDMA transaction as not supported. Pushing the
find_parent_pci_dev() logic into the callers is, IMO, just asking the
callers to replicate a bunch of logic it shouldn't even be aware of
creating messier code as a result.
