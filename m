At a glance, this all looks about the right shape to me now, thanks!

Ideally I'd hope patch #4 could go straight to device_iommu_capable() 
from my Thunderbolt series, but we can figure that out in a couple of 
weeks once Joerg starts queueing 5.19 material. I've got another VFIO 
patch waiting for the DMA ownership series to land anyway, so it's 
hardly the end of the world if I have to come back to follow up on this 
one too.

For the series,
