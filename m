Yes, my understanding is that this is optional not mandatory.

I may miss something, here's my understanding is that:

- page request descriptor will only be used when PRS is enabled
- ATS spec allows unaligned request

So any reason for disabling ATS for unaligned request even if PRS is
not enabled?

So far only emulated devices. But we are helping some vendor to
implement virtio hardware so  we need to understand the connection
between ATS alignment and page request descriptor.

Thanks for the reminding, but it looks to me according to the ATS
spec, all PRI message is 4096 byte aligned? E.g lower bites were used
for group index etc.

Thanks
