Hi Lorenzo, Robin,

What we definitely need is the correct representation of the MC in ACPI case. To achieve that we will define it as Platform Device but not with EFI_ACPI_IORT_ID_MAPPING_FLAGS_SINGLE.
Also for the Named Component Node we will have .NumIdMappings = 2. One mapping will have the range of IDs for DPRC device and a separate table will have the ID for MC device itself.

Having said this, the patch set which is currently under discussion doesn't cater this representation, but solution proposed by Lorenzo and Robin is in that direction only and we in theory agree to that.
But further to this needs few clarifications as well.

Now for ACPI case what we definitely need is the option to take Input ID into the consideration for Platform device if it is not with Single ID mapping flag. We can handle both MSI and IOMMU cases with that, and in fact a patch with this implementation for MSI is already posted by Pankaj and under review, and we would need similar approach for IOMMU case as well. I would appreciate if Lorenzo can elaborate more on how he is going to generalize iort_msi_map_rid() function.

For DT case, currently MC is represented as a separate bus just like PCI. It would not make sense to keep it that way while in ACPI case it is represented in a different way. Because of this we would like to take a similar approach with the DT as well.
Please post your patches with the changes you mentioned earlier, and meanwhile we will also do some PoC activity for both ACPI and DT case and will post a new set of patch with that.

--Thanks
Makarand
