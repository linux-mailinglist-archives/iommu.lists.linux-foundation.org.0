> This series introduces an iova list associated with a vfio
> iommu. The list is kept updated taking care of iommu apertures,
> and reserved regions. Also this series adds checks for any conflict

> the domain.
> 
> User-space can retrieve valid iova ranges using VFIO_IOMMU_GET_INFO
> ioctl capability chains. Any dma map request outside the valid iova
> range will be rejected.

> v5 --> v6
> 
>  -Rebased to 4.17-rc1
>  -Changed the ordering such that previous patch#7 "iommu/dma: Move
>   PCI window region reservation back...")  is now patch #4. This
>   will avoid any bisection issues pointed out by Alex.
>  -Added Robins's Reviewed-by tag for patch#4
> 
> v4 --> v5
> Rebased to next-20180315.
> 
>  -Incorporated the corner case bug fix suggested by Alex to patch #5.
>  -Based on suggestions by Alex and Robin, added patch#7. This
>   moves the PCI window  reservation back in to DMA specific path.
>   This is to fix the issue reported by Eric[1].
> 
> v3 --> v4
>  Addressed comments received for v3.
>  -dma_addr_t instead of phys_addr_t
>  -LIST_HEAD() usage.
>  -Free up iova_copy list in case of error.
>  -updated logic in filling the iova caps info(patch #5)
> 
> RFCv2 --> v3
>  Removed RFC tag.
>  Addressed comments from Alex and Eric:
>  - Added comments to make iova list management logic more clear.
>  - Use of iova list copy so that original is not altered in
>    case of failure.
> 
> RFCv1 --> RFCv2
>  Addressed comments from Alex:
> -Introduced IOVA list management and added checks for conflicts with
>  existing dma map entries during attach/detach.
