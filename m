That's fine. In this case we're only talking about the low-level IOMMU 
code which has to be in cahoots with the driver core to some degree (via 
these new callbacks) anyway, but if you're uncomfortable about relying 
on dev->driver even there, I can live with that. There are several 
potential places to capture the relevant information in IOMMU API 
private data, from the point in really_probe() where it *is* stable, and 
then never look at dev->driver ever again - even from .dma_cleanup() or 
future equivalent, which is the aspect from whence this whole 
proof-of-concept tangent span out.

Cheers,
Robin.
