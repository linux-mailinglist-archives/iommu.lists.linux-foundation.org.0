Indeed the driver can't cache arbitrary pointers, but if typical buffers 
are small enough it can copy the data into its own already-mapped page, 
dma_sync it, and perform the DMA operation from there. That might even 
be more or less what your first suggestion was, but I'm still not quite 
sure.

Right, and if reusing buffers is common in crypto callers, then there's 
an argument for "set up reusable buffer", "process updated buffer" and 
"clean up buffer" operations to be added to the crypto API itself, such 
that the underlying drivers can then optimise for DMA usage in a robust 
and obvious way if they want to (or just implement the setup and 
teardown as no-ops and still do a full map/unmap in each "process" call 
if they don't).

Robin.
