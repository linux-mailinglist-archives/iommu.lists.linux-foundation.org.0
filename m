if vfio-pci cannot construct endpoint alone in all cases, then I worried
we are just inventing unnecessary uAPI objects of which the role can 
be already fulfilled by device cookie+PASID in the proposed uAPI.

Sticking to iommu semantics {device, pasid} are clear enough for 
the user to build the connection between IOAS and device. This 
also matches the vIOMMU part which just understands vRID and 
vPASID, without any concept of endpoint. anyway RID+PASID (or 
SID+SSID) is what is defined in the bus to tag an IOAS. Forcing 
vIOMMU to fake an endpoint (via vfio) per PASID before doing 
attach just adds unnecessary confusion.

We just need define a better name to cover pasid, ssid, or other ids. 
regardless of the bus type, it's always the device cookie to identify 
the default I/O address space plus a what-ever id to tag other I/O 
address spaces targeted by the device.

the IOMMU routes incoming DMA packets to a specific I/O page table,
according to RID or RID+PASID carried in the packet. RID or RID+PASID
is the routing information (represented by device cookie +PASID in
proposed uAPI) and what the iommu driver really cares when activating 
the I/O page table in the iommu.
