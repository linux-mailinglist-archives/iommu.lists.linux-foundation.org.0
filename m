It is not just takes too long, but also accidently causing locking
problems by doing very complex code in the release callback. Unless
you audit all the mmput call sites to define the calling conditions I
can't even say what the risk is here. 

Particularly, calling something with impossible to audit locking like
the dma_fence stuff from release is probably impossible to prove
safety and then keep safe.

It is easy enough to see where takes too long can have a bad impact,
mmput is called all over the place. Just in the RDMA code slowing it
down would block ODP page faulting completely for all processes.
This is not acceptable.

For this reason release callbacks must be simple/fast and must have
trivial locking.

Why not make the pgd present as I suggested? Point it at a static
dummy pgd that always fails to page fault during release? Make the pgd
not present only once the PASID is fully destroyed.

That really is the only thing release is supposed to mean -> unmap all
VAs.
