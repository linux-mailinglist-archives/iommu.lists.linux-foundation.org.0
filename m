Right, I was just about to respond with the same. ;-) So overall right
now we're blocked waiting for someone to point out the error in my
logic. ;-)

Rob: I'd be happy if you wanted to comment on that thread. If you say
that it's fine to add a generic device tree property to control
strictness then I'm more than happy to add support for it. I've been
going on the theory that you'd NAK such a property but I'm totally
good with being wrong. ;-)

I'd be more than happy if you could suggest what you'd envision such a
property to be named.
