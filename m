Rest assured that I understand the situation all too well ;) As with 
tegra-gart, the unspoken point here is that since tegra-smmu implements 
of_xlate(), then arm_setup_iommu_dma_ops() must already be causing the 
exact same problem, no? This patch only seeks to move any existing 
behaviour over to the common backend, regardless of whether it was ever 
really appropriate in the first place.

That would mean you'd see a functional change from the final patch, 
wherein nothing would ever be able to get translation unless drivers do 
their own explicit IOMMU API management. If you definitely want that 
change then OK, but it would still be nice to do it "properly" with 
IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY support, rather than just forcibly failing default 
domain allocation. I'm having a go at reworking the tegra-gart patch in 
that direction, so I can certainly try it for tegra-smmu as well.

Robin.
