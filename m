Hi All,

Just a gentle reminder, any feedback on the options I listed below? New
ideas will be even better.

Christoph, does the explanation make sense to you? We do have the
capability/flag based scheme for IOMMU API extension, the version is
mainly used for size lookup. Compatibility checking is another use of
the version, it makes checking easy when a vIOMMU is launched.

Thanks,

Jacob
