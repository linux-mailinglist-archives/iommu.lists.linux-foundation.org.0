Correct, since we have usage with ENQCMD, its more like

- Give me a PASID1 (not attached to any RID)
- Bind/attach PASID1 with RID1
- Bind/attach PASID1 with RID2

and ENQCMD isn't just for Intel, with the DMWr spec in PCI, it brings it to
all devices as long as routing is supported by interim switches and such.

We do have a RID involvement with PASID always for security. Every RID has
its own PASID table, but the PASID name space is global. 

So if you have RID1 associated with PASID1, another RID2 doesn't have the
PASID1 in its PASID table. Until when the app binds PASID1 with RID2 as
well. Then you have PASID1 plumbed in the PASID table for RID2.

Is this what you refer to for security?

Like I mentioned, this isn't just Intel going forward. The specs are public
in PCIe. I just can't comment which other vendors are adopting it.

I don't think this has any decent change of success. Its rather round about
way to get a global PASID namespace.

This seems a bit complicated. Another way to specify this.

- IOASID is a logical construct to specify a page table.
- You can bind a global PASID to an IOASID

We aren't loosing any security by using a global PASID name space. 
Until the application asks for it, that is not bound to any other RID without an explicit
request.
