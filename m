And even if there are, as above they've never actually been fully 
protected and still won't be, so it's arguably a good thing for them to 
stop thinking so.

Heh, let's just hope the other half-dozen or so subsystems I need to 
touch for this IOMMU cleanup aren't all quite as involved as this turned 
out to be :)

Cheers,
