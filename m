Hi Bjorn and Zhangfei,

We plan to use ATS/PRI to support SVA in future PCI devices. However, for
current devices, we need to add limited number of quirk to let them
work. The device IDs of current quirk needed devices are ZIP engine(0xa250, 0xa251),
SEC engine(0xa255, 0xa256), HPRE engine(0xa258, 0xa259), revision id are
0x21 and 0x30.

Let's continue to upstream these quirks!

Best,
Zhou
