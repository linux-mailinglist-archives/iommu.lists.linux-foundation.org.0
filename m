I'm not sure we're on the same page here, so sorry if this was already impl=
ied.

The crashkernel memory mapping is bypassed while preparing the linear mappi=
ngs
but it is then mapped right away, with page granularity and !MTE.
See paging_init()->map_mem():

	/*
	 * Use page-level mappings here so that we can shrink the region
	 * in page granularity and put back unused memory to buddy system
	 * through /sys/kernel/kexec_crash_size interface.
	 */
	if (crashk_res.end) {
		__map_memblock(pgdp, crashk_res.start, crashk_res.end + 1,
			       PAGE_KERNEL,
			       NO_BLOCK_MAPPINGS | NO_CONT_MAPPINGS);
		memblock_clear_nomap(crashk_res.start,
				     resource_size(&crashk_res));
	}

IIUC the inconvenience here is that we need special mapping options for
crashkernel and updating those after having mapped that memory as regular
memory isn't possible/easy to do.

arch_kexec_protect_crashkres() depends on __change_memory_common() which
ultimately depends on the memory to be mapped with PAGE_SIZE pages. As I
comment above, the trick would work as long as there is as way to update th=
e
linear mappings with whatever crashkernel needs later in the boot process.

Overall, I'd prefer (1) as well, and I'd be happy to have a got at it. If n=
ot
I'll append (3) in this series.
