Yes I understand this and I sympathize with it, not the most beautiful thin=
g
out there :). But that's only half the issue, as I said, implementing this
early at boot time is a tangible amount of work and a burden to maintain ju=
st
for one board. So this is the compromise we discussed with the DT maintaine=
r
(RobH). The series sets things up so as to be able to implement the right
thing transparently to arm64's architecture when deemed worth the effort.

Ultimately, if you're worried about inserting knowledge into the code, aren=
't
we doing that, in a more extreme way, when imposing an extra unwarranted zo=
ne
to the whole arm64 ecosystem?

Note that I'm more that happy to work on alternative solutions, but let's f=
irst
settle on what would be acceptable to everyone.

Don't know much about what ACPI memory cold plugging involves, but we'll st=
ill
need a proper ZONE_DMA32 (i.e. spanning the whole 32-bit address space) for
RPi4.
