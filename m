The device driver would need to tell stop sending any new PR's.

I can see how the device can complete #2,3 above. But the device driver
isn't the one managing page-responses right. So in order for the device to
know the above sequence is complete, it would need to get some assist from
IOMMU driver?

How does the driver know that everything host received has been responded
back to device?

True, but there could be some page-request in flight on its way to the
IOMMU. By draining and getting that round trip back to IOMMU we gaurantee
things in flight are flushed to PRQ after that Drain completes.
