True. But I'd still prefer to have a more formal mechanism of handing
out access to registers.

Either way, this isn't very relevant in the case of tegra20-devfreq
because there's really no reason for it to be a separate driver with
device tree lookup since it's all internal to the MC driver. The only
reason (unless I'm missing something) for that is to have the code
located in drivers/devfreq. We can do that without requiring DT lookup
either like we did for tegra-smmu/tegra-mc, or by directly copying the
code into drivers/memory.

It's become fairly common in recent years to group code by IP rather
than functionality. We nowadays have good tools to help with subsystem
wide refactoring that make it much less necessary for subsystem code to
be concentrated in a single directory.

I assumed that by "fall back" you meant the lookup-by-compatible. But
what I was talking about is the fall back to the current code which does
not use the MC device tree node at all. The latter is going to be
required to ensure that the code continues to work as-is. But the former
is not required because we have fall back code that already works with
old device trees. New code that is using the memory controller's timings
nodes can be gated on the existence of the phandle in DT and doing so is
not going to break backwards-compatibility.

But perhaps I was misunderstanding what you were trying to say.
