that makes sense. thanks!

Global and pluggable are for slightly separate reasons.
- We need global PASID on VT-d in that we need to support shared
workqueues (SWQ). E.g. One SWQ can be wrapped into two mdevs then assigned
to two VMs. Each VM uses its private guest PASID to submit work but
each guest PASID must be translated to a global (system-wide) host PASID to
avoid conflict. Also, since PASID table storage is per PF, if two mdevs of
the same PF are assigned to different VMs, the PASIDs must be unique.

- The pluggable allocator is to support the option where the guest PASIDs
are allocated by the hypervisor. Let it be the same as the host PASID or
some arbitrary number cooked up by the hypervisor but backed by a host HW
PASID. VT-d spec has this virtual command interface that requires the guest
to use it instead of allocating from the guest ioasid xarray. This is the
reason why it has to go down to iommu vendor driver. I guess that is what
you meant by "went to some trouble to isolate everything into iommu"?

For ARM, since the guest owns the per device PASID table. There is no need
to allocate PASIDs from the host nor the hypervisor. Without SWQ, there is
no need for global PASID/SSID either. So PASID being global for ARM is for
simplicity in case of host PASID/SSID.
