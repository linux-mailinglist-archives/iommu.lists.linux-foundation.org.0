I agree the uAPI data tunneling is definitely flawed in terms of
scalability.

I was just thinking it is still a small part of the overall
picture. Considering there are other parts such as fault reporting, user
space deployment, performance, and security. By completing the support on
the existing VFIO framework, it would at least offer a clear landscape where
the new /dev/ioasid can improve upon.

Perhaps similar to cgroup v1 vs v2, it took a long time and with known
limitations in v1.

Anyway, I am glad we have a clear direction now.

Thanks,

Jacob
