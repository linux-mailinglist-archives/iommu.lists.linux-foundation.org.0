I do think that the IOMMU stuff needs better debugging. I've hit the
WARN_ON() in __arm_lpae_map(), and it's been pretty much undebuggable,
so I've resorted to putting the IOMMU into bypass mode permanently to
work around the issue.

The reason that it's undebuggable is if one puts printk() or trace
statements in the code, boots the platform, you get flooded with those
debugging messages, because every access to the rootfs generates and
tears down a mapping.

It would be nice to be able to inspect the IOMMU page tables and state
of the IOMMU, rather than having to resort to effectively disabling
the IOMMU.

FTTP is here! 40Mbps down 10Mbps up. Decent connectivity at last!
