Ok, I'll ping them. There's already a thread I opened at the DRM devel
ML about this driver. IMHO, there's nothing on this specific driver
that would prevent having it on staging for a while, until the two
or three remaining bugs gets fixed.

On the other hand, the code already follows the current DRM policies,
as far as I can tell. The bugs are related to some specific register
settings that would need to be better tuned (and maybe some delay
when waiting for EDID data at the already-existing adv7535 driver).
Maybe it would be preferred to have it at drivers/gpu even with
such bugs.

It is OK for me to working for a week or so, until the iommu people
become happy with that. 

The main reason of submitting via staging is that I need to preserve
the patch that added this driver as-is, in order to preserve its
SoB and not causing legal issues.

It it is OK for iommu to accept a submission like that, I can
re-submit it, doing the changes at drivers/iommu.

If not, besides this series, the only alternative I can think of is to 
merge it first at the staging, with the incremental changes, and with
a final patch moving the code out of staging.

Thanks,
Mauro
