In our case we don't have SPTEs, the whole pgd is shared between MMU and
IOMMU (isolated using PASID tables).

Taking the concrete example of the crypto accelerator:

1. A process opens a queue in the accelerator. That queue is bound to the
   address space: a PASID is allocated for the mm, and mm->pgd is written
   into the IOMMU PASID table.
2. The process queues some work and waits. In the background, the
   accelerators performs DMA on the process address space, by using the
   mm's PASID.
3. Now the process gets killed, and release() is called.

At this point no one told the device to stop working on this queue, it may
still be doing DMA on this address space. So the first thing we do is
notify the device driver that the bond is going away, and that it must
stop the queue and flush remaining DMA transactions for this PASID.

Then we also clear the pgd from the IOMMU PASID table. If we only did
invalidate-all and somehow the queue wasn't properly stopped, concurrent
DMA would immediately form new IOTLB entries since the page tables haven't
been wiped at this point. And later, it would use-after-free page tables
and mappings. Whereas with a clear pgd it would just generate IOMMU fault
events, which are undesirable but harmless.

Thanks,
Jean
