Virtio-iommu can use the PCI transport [3], in which case you need a
finer-grained approach. In some implementations you'll have the IOMMU
interface and endpoints managed by that IOMMU under the same RC. I'm not
proud of it.

It's not as generic as device-tree, each vendor has their own table to
describe the IOMMU topology. I don't see a nice way to transpose the
add_links() callback there. Links need to be created either in a common
path (iommu_probe_device()) or in the APCI IORT driver.

Oh right, device_link_add() would reuse an existing link. It even seems to
work for IOMMU drivers that want to manage PM links themselves
(DL_FLAG_STATELESS).

Yes I admit I only glanced over it, but it seems like a nice solution. At
the moment of_iommu_xlate() handles the dependency itself. It currently
give up after initcalls but than can be tweaked to wait indefinitely (my
patch [2]). If of_devlink was enabled by default and handled iommu-map it
could probably replace the of_iommu probe deferral. For now it might be
best to manage device links somewhere in the IOMMU core, so ACPI
implementations (which do probe deferral their own way) can benefit from
it as well.

Thanks,
Jean
