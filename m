With the current kernel, we get a ZONE_DMA already with an arbitrary
size of 1GB that matches what RPi4 needs. We are trying to eliminate
such unnecessary ZONE_DMA based on some heuristics (well, something that
looks "better" than a OEM ID based quirk). Now, if we learn that IORT
for platforms in the field is that broken as to describe few bits-wide
DMA masks, we may have to go back to the OEM ID quirk.
