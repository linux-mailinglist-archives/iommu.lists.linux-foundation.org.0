Right, I mixed up "token" with the private data associated with each
IOASID. I had mostly forgotten about the principles you introduced in the
"IOASID extensions for guest SVA" series, sorry for the confusion.

I'm not fond of using init_mm for the host PASID set. Does it need a token
at all?

Please disregard this, it was replacing the void* argument of
ioasid_alloc() with an mm_struct.

Same here, this was replacing the void* returned by ioasid_find() with an
mm_struct.

Yes I think it would be easier to discuss with code.
