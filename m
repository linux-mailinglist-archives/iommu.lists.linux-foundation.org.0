I'm fairly sceptical of the idea of allowing the "identifiable
requestor" grouping to be different from the isolation grouping.
Certainly it's possible in hardware, but I think it makes the
interface horribly complex to understand without buying much.

"Good" modern devices on modern systems will be both fully isolated
and well identified, so for the uses cases that people seem to mostly
care about here we'll still have identification group =3D=3D isolation
group =3D=3D one device.

In other words, do we really have use cases where we need to identify
different devices IDs, even though we know they're not isolated.
