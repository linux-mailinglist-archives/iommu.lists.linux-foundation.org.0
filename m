I think it _should_ return DEV_DMA_COHERENT on x86/IA-64 (unless a _CCA 
method was actually present to say otherwise), based on 
acpi_init_coherency(), but I only know for sure what happens on arm64.

TBH I don't see any issue with current name, but I'd certainly be happy 
to nail down a specific definition for it, along the lines of "this 
means that IOMMU_CACHE mappings are generally coherent". That works for 
things like Arm's S2FWB making it OK to assign an otherwise-non-coherent 
device without extra hassle.

For the specific case of overriding PCIe No Snoop (which is more 
problematic from an Arm SMMU PoV) when assigning to a VM, would that not 
be easier solved by just having vfio-pci clear the "Enable No Snoop" 
control bit in the endpoint's PCIe capability?

That seems a pretty good summary - I think they're basically all 
"firmware told Linux I'm coherent so I'd better act coherent" cases, but 
that still doesn't necessarily mean that they're *forced* to respect 
that. One of the things on my to-do list is to try adding a 
DMA_ATTR_NO_SNOOP that can force DMA cache maintenance for coherent 
devices, primarily to hook up in Panfrost (where there is a bit of a 
performance to claw back on the coherent AmLogic SoCs by leaving certain 
buffers non-cacheable).

Cheers,
Robin.
