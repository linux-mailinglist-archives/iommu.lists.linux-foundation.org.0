Can you explain the current logic here? It's not entirely clear to me 
whether the VCMDQ is actually meant to support CMD_SYNC or not.

Ah, sorry, I haven't had the bandwidth to dig back through all the 
previous threads. Thanks for clarifying - I'm still not sure why any 
notion of stage 2 would be exposed to guests at all, but at least it 
sounds like there's no functional concern here, other than constraining 
the number of devices which can be assigned to a single VM, but I think 
that falls into the bucket of information that userspace VMMs will have 
to learn about this kind of direct IOMMU interface assignment anyway 
(most importantly, the relationship of assigned devices to vIOMMUs 
suddenly has to start reflecting the underlying physical topology).

Out of interest, would ATC_INV with an unmatched StreamID raise an error 
or just be ignored? Particularly if the host gets a chance to handle a 
GError and decide whether CMDQ_CONS.ERR is reported back to the guest or 
not, there's scope to do some interesting things for functionality and 
robustness.

Cheers,
Robin.
