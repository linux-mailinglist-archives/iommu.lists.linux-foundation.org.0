Hi, I found the problematic memory region. It was a memory
chunk reserved/removed in the downstream tree but was
seemingly reserved upstream for different drivers. I failed to
calculate the length of the total region reserved downstream
correctly. And there was still a portion of memory left unmarked,
which I should have marked as reserved in my testing earlier
today.

Sorry for all the noise and thanks Nicolas, Christoph and David
for your patience.

Regards,
Amit Pundir
