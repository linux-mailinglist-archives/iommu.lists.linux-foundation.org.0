Is this achieved by VCMD or by capturing guest's PASID cache invalidation?

yeah, if this scheme for scenario 3) is good. We may limit the range of
local PASIDs by limiting the PASID bit width of vIOMMU. QEMU can get the
local PASID allocated by guest IOMMU when guest does PASID cache invalidation.
