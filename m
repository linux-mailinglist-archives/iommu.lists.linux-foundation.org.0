I don't really know about any active users, but experience tells that some platforms really are used for quite a long time, even if they are somewhat obscure. N900 or Netwinder, anyone?

On the one hand it's a decent LPAE platform (with memory actually exceeding 4GB), and on the other hand it's something with capable I/O (SATA) and networking, so one can actually stress test the system. Which is the reason I was using that for KVM testing, but even with that probably going away now there remain still some use cases, and be it for general ARM(32) testing.

Does LPAE with more than 4GB actually need to work if there's not
another platform out there?

> I don't particularly care about the more optional parts like EDAC, cpuidle, or cpufreq, but I wonder if keeping in at least the rather small SATA and XGMAC drivers and basic platform support is feasible.

cpuidle isn't actually stable from what I remember. I think without
cpufreq, we default to 1.1GHz instead of 1.4.

Thanks!

All the reset/suspend/poweroff and coherency parts are shared. The SCU
and L2 parts could be removed, but not really worth the surgery IMO.
