Hi David,

Thanks for the answer. The only unusual thing about our DMA is that we
only do 64 bit DMA and IOVAs are always >2^32. I don't think I
triggered a bug in your code though, rather I think I made some mistake
in the rebase onto 5.18 as some of the APIs changed a bit. I'm out next
week but may try it again and possibly just test on x86_64 if it
doesn't work on s390. If you have anything new I'd be interested to
hear of course. Also could you say anything more about the pathological
usage patterns?

Thanks,
Niklas
