Oh cock... sorry, all this time I've been saying what I *expect* it to 
do, while overlooking the fact that the IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT 
hunks were the bits I forgot to write and Christoph had to fix up. 
Indeed, those should be checking the domain type too to preserve the 
existing behaviour. Apologies for the confusion.
