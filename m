Just want to make sure that I understand you correctly.

We should use the existing IOMMU in-kernel APIs to connect mdev with the
iommu subsystem, so that the upper lays don't need to use something
like (if dev_is_mdev) to handle mdev differently. Do I get you
correctly?

Yes. Agreed. I will look into it.
