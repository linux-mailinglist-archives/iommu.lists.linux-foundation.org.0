Well, and broke a big amount of devices that were otherwise fine.

Is it worth the effort just for a single board? I don't know about ACPI but
parsing dma-ranges that early at boot time is not trivial. My intuition tel=
ls
me that it'd be even harder for ACPI, being a more complex data structure.

Actually what I proposed here is pretty generic. Specially from arm64's
perspective. We call early_init_dt_scan(), which sets up zone_dma_bits base=
d on
whatever it finds in DT. Both those operations are architecture independent=
.
arm64 arch code doesn't care about the logic involved in ascertaining
zone_dma_bits. I get that the last step isn't generic. But it's all setup s=
o as
to make it as such whenever it's worth the effort.

Any ideas? The way I understand it the kdump issue is just a shortcoming of
the memory zones design.

Nicolas
