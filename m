I agree that it "makes sense" to pay attention to this property no
matter where it appears, but since that Microsoft doc went to the
trouble to restrict it to Root Ports, I think we should leave this
as-is and only look for it in the Root Port.  Otherwise Linux will
accept something Windows will reject, and that seems like a needless
difference.

We can at least include the above link to the Microsoft doc in the
commit log.

I agree, you can defer this until you see a need for it.  I just
pointed it out in case it would be useful to you.

Right.  There's also something wrong with "enumerated downstream an".
