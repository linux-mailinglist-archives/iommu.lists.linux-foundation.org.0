"Support the 'DmaProperty' with the same semantics as 'DmaProperty'"
doesn't help much, so there must be a little more to the story :)

I know, but it's similar, and I'm just hoping we can deal with them
consistently.

We need to either mention the fact that we're going beyond what the MS
web page says or (ideally, as you are doing) get the page updated with
the semantics you need.

I think it's OK to make it ACPI-specific for now.
