I don't think we have to. Linux uses "identity" domains and "passthrough"
IOMMU. The old virtio-iommu feature was "bypass" so we should keep that
for the new one, to be consistent. And then I've used "bypass" for domains
as well, in the spec, because it would look strange to use a different
term for the same concept. I find that it sort of falls into place: Linux'
identity domains can be implemented either with bypass or identity-mapped
virtio-iommu domains.

The spec talks about *device* reset, triggered by software writing 0 to
the status register, but it doesn't mention system reset. Would be good to
clarify that. Something like:

    If the device offers the VIRTIO_IOMMU_F_BYPASS_CONFIG feature, it MAY
    initialize the \field{bypass} field to 1. Field \field{bypass} SHOULD
    NOT change on device reset, but SHOULD be restored to its initial
    value on system reset.

So I think clarifying system reset should address your questions.
I believe we should leave bypass sticky across device reset, so a FW->OS
transition, where the OS resets the device, does not open a vulnerability
(if bypass was enabled at boot and then left disabled by FW.)

It's still a good idea for the OS to restore on shutdown the bypass value
it was booted with. So it can kexec into an OS that doesn't support
virtio-iommu, for example.

Thanks,
Jean
