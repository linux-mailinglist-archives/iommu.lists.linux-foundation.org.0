I can at least confirm that it has not caught anything in a long while
except a false positive that needed a fix up.

Part of me says it's not doing anything worthwhile upstream, but I
wonder if it is keeping some people from submitting patches that play
these page reference shenanigans? I know they're out there. The land
of gup and truncate is where questionable kernel changes go to die.

Outside of that, Hugh's patch looks like a definite improvement so I'd
be inclined to run with that, but rip the whole facility out at the
next sign of a false positive.
