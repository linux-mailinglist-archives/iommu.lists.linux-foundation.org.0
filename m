If this is a concern, we can make IOVA_MAG_SIZE tunable in Kconfig.
I myself want a larger IOVA_MAG_SIZE at least for experiments.
You know, servers now have 100G+ memory, 192k is nearly nothing...

I don't follow you either. I thought you are suggesting to completely
get rid of dynamic memory allocations like:

@@ -31,7 +31,7 @@ struct iova_cpu_rcache;
 struct iova_rcache {
        spinlock_t lock;
        unsigned long depot_size;
-       struct iova_magazine *depot[MAX_GLOBAL_MAGS];
+       struct iova_magazine depot[MAX_GLOBAL_MAGS];
        struct iova_cpu_rcache __percpu *cpu_rcaches;
 };

If it is so, I don't see how I can do swap() with pointers like
cpu_rcache->prev.

More importantly, this doesn't save any memory either for your embedded
case. So I don't know why you want to bring it up.

Just FYI: The latency is 10x/20x worse with IOMMU enabled on AMD
servers here. (mlx5 driver for ethernet, if matters.) The throughput
is roughly same. The patchset you linked only measures throughput.

I must miss the dynamic size part, as I tried to tune IOVA_MAG_SIZE
manually when I initially thought it is overcached.

Are you saying fixed-size implementation is wrong? I'd like to hear
more! :) I am curious how to dynamically adjust the magzine size
too as I still don't believe IOVA_MAG_SIZE fits all, also how to
balance the percpu cache. Can you be more elaborate?

Thanks.
