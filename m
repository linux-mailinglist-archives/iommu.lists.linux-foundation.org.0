It was only on v5 of the patchset - *six months* after the original RFC 
posting - that anyone even first started to question the initial 
assumptions made about attributes[1], and even then somebody familiar 
countered that it didn't appear to matter[2]. Sorry, but you don't get 
to U-turn and throw unjust shade at Arm for not being prescient.

Yes, when those of us within Arm set out the initial RMR spec, an 
assumption was made that it seemed reasonable for an OS to simply pick 
some default strong memory type (Device or Normal-NC) and full 
permissions if it did need to map RMRs at stage 1. That spec was 
reviewed and published externally and no interested parties came forth 
asking "hey, what about attributes?". Linux patches were written around 
that assumption and proceeded through many rounds of review until we 
eventually received sufficient feedback to demonstrate that the 
assumption did not in fact hold well enough in general and there seemed 
to be a genuine need for RMR attributes, and at that point we started 
work on revising the spec.

In the meantime, these patches have sat at v7 for four months - the 
*other* outstanding review comments have not been addressed; I still 
don't recall seeing an answer about whether LX2160 or anything else 
currently deployed actually *needs* cacheable mappings or whether it 
could muddle through with the IOMMU_MMIO assumption until proper "RMR 
v2" support arrived later; even if so, an interim workaround specific to 
LX2160 could have been proposed but hasn't. It is hardly reasonable to 
pretend that Arm or the upstream maintainers are responsible for a lack 
of development activity on the part of the submitters, no matter how 
much blatant misinformation is repeated on Twitter.

Regards,
Robin.
