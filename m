Right now things are a bit awkward if a driver would like a chance to
run before some of the more "automatic" things (pinctrl, DMA, IOMMUs,
...) happen to a device. This patch aims to fix that problem by
introducing the concept of a "pre_probe" function that drivers can
implement to run before the "automatic" stuff.

Why would you want to run before the "automatic" stuff? The incentive
in my case is that I want to be able to fill in some boolean flags in
the "struct device" before the IOMMU init runs. It appears that the
strictness vs. non-strictness of a device's iommu config is determined
once at init time and can't be changed afterwards. However, I would
like to avoid hardcoding the rules for strictness in the IOMMU
driver. Instead I'd like to let individual drivers be able to make
informed decisions about the appropriateness of strictness
vs. non-strictness.

The desire for running code pre_probe is likely not limited to my use
case. I believe that the list "qcom_smmu_client_of_match" is hacked
into the iommu driver specifically because there was no real good
framework for this. For the existing list it wasn't _quite_ as ugly as
my needs since the decision could be made solely on compatible string,
but it still feels like it would have been better for individual
drivers to run code and setup some state rather than coding up a big
list in the IOMMU driver.

Even without this patch, I believe it is possible for a driver to run
before the "automatic" things by registering for
"BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER" in its init call, though I haven't personally
tested this. Using the notifier is a bit awkward, though, and I'd
rather avoid it. Also, using "BUS_NOTIFY_BIND_DRIVER" would require
drivers to stop using the convenience module_platform_driver() helper
and roll a bunch of boilerplate code.

NOTE: the pre_probe here is listed in the driver structure. As a side
effect of this it will be passed a "struct device *" rather than the
more specific device type (like the "struct platform_device *" that
most platform devices get passed to their probe). Presumably this
won't cause trouble and it's a lot less code to write but if we need
to make it more symmetric that's also possible by touching more files.
