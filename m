I think we might have a misunderstanding of what ioasid_set is. Or i
have misused your original intention for it:) So my understanding of an
ioasid_set is to identify a sub set of IOASIDs that
1. shares the same data type
2. belongs to the same permission group, owner.

Our usage is #2., we put a mm_struct as the set to do permission
check. E.g VFIO can check guest PASID ownership based on QEMU process
mm. This will make sure IOASID allocated by one guest can only be used
by the same guest.

For IOASID used for sva bind, let it be native or guest sva, we always
have the same data type. Therefore, when page request handler gets
called to search with ioasid_find(), it knows its data type. An
additional flag will tell if it is a guest bind or native bind.

I was under the assumption that aux domain and its IOASID is a 1:1
mapping, there is no need for a search. Or even it needs to search, it
will be searched by the same caller that did the allocation, therefore
it knows what private data type is.

In addition, aux domain is used for request w/o PASID. And PPR for
request w/o PASID is not to be supported. So there would not be a need
to search from page request handler.

Now if we take the above assumption away, and use ioasid_set strictly
to differentiate the data types (Usage #1). Then I agree we can get
rid of NULL set and global search.

That would require we converge on the generic sva_bind for both
native and guest. The additional implication is that VFIO layer has to
be SVA struct aware in order to sanitize the mm_struct for guest bind.
i.e. check guest ownership by using QEMU process mm. Whereas we have
today, VFIO just use IOASID set as mm to check ownership, no need to
know the type.

Can we keep the NULL set for now and remove it __after__ we converge on
the sva bind flows?

Thanks,

Jacob
