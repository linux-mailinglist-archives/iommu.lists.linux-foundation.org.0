It's my opinion that until there is a place in the kernel to "fixup"
broken device trees that were baked in firmware that it's a bad idea
to ship device trees separate from the kernel except if the device
trees are exceedingly simple.  We'll run into too many problems
otherwise, either because the kernel the device tree was written for
had downstream patches or someone just made a mistake in them and
nobody noticed.  I know device trees are supposed to be ABI, but
people make mistakes and we need a way to fix them up.

...but that's getting pretty far afield from Robin's patch.

Depends on what you're doing.  If you're not in the habit of compiling
a kernel and you're just trying to make one work then the command line
is great.  If you're trying to manage configuration for a whole bunch
of different hardware products then the command line is a terrible
place to store config.

...but I guess the summary is that we wouldn't want someone to
actually ship a kernel with this option on anyway.  ;-)

Fine with me if it's not too long for an error message.
