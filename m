I think we are all in violent agreement. A lot of times the pci spec gets
defined several years ahead of real products and no one remembers
the justification on why they restricted things the way they did.

Maybe someone early product wasn't quite exposing these features to the VF
and hence the spec is bug compatible :-)

As long as the capability enable is only provided when the PF has enabled
the feature. Then it seems the hardware seems to do the right thing.

Assume we expose PASID/PRI only when PF has enabled it. It will be the
case since the PF driver needs to exist, and IOMMU would have set the 
PASID/PRI/ATS on PF.

If the emulation is purely spoofing the capability. Once vIOMMU driver
enables PASID, the context entries for the VF are completely independent
from the PF context entries. 

vIOMMU would enable PASID, and we just spoof the PASID capability.

If vIOMMU or guest for some reason does disable_pasid(), then the 
vIOMMU driver can disaable PASID on the VF context entries. So the VF
although the capability is blanket enabled on PF, IOMMU gaurantees the
transactions are blocked.


In the interim, it seems like the intent of the virtual capability
can be honored via help from the IOMMU for the controlling aspect.. 

Did i miss anything?

I think this is a good long term solution, but if the vIOMMU implenentations
can carry us for the time being, we can probably defer them unless
we are stuck.
