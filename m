Sure, it doesn't take too many extra instructions to start matching 
typical IDIV latency, so there's no point being silly if there really 
isn't a clean alternative.

Some quick scribbling suggests "4 - ilog2(granule) / 10" might actually 
be close enough, but perhaps that's a bit too cheeky.

Now that I think about it, the case that frustrated me may have had the 
shift and divide in separate statements - that's probably a lot harder 
to analyse than a single expression. Either way, the simple right shift 
is easier to read IMO.

Indeed, I hadn't quite got my head round your algorithm at first, so 
deriving this was as much to help me get a better feel for the problem 
as anything. Now I see that "minimise the remainder" really boils down 
to "remove up to 5 high-order bits each time", which in turn is 
essentially the same thing just done in the other direction (and in a 
slightly more cumbersome manner). Now that I do get it, your algorithm 
is in fact really neat, sorry for doubting :)

FWIW it might be a little more efficient to maintain scale outside the 
loop, such that num_pages can simply be shifted right to lose the 
low-order bits each iteration, but other than that I think it's pretty 
much as good as it can get.

Thanks,
Robin.
