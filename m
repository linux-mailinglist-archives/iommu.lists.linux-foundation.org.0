We need the ATF support for memory MPU (memory protection unit).
Restricted DMA (with reserved-memory in dts) makes sure the predefined memory
region is for PCIe DMA only, but we still need MPU to locks down PCIe access to
that specific regions.

Only the streaming DMA (map/unmap) needs bounce buffering.
I also added alloc/free support in this series
(https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1360995/), so dma_direct_alloc() will
try to allocate memory from the predefined memory region.

As for the performance hit, it should be similar to the default swiotlb.
Here are my experiment results. Both SoCs lack IOMMU for PCIe.

PCIe wifi vht80 throughput -

  MTK SoC                  tcp_tx     tcp_rx    udp_tx   udp_rx
  w/o Restricted DMA  244.1     134.66   312.56   350.79
  w/ Restricted DMA    246.95   136.59   363.21   351.99

  Rockchip SoC           tcp_tx     tcp_rx    udp_tx   udp_rx
  w/o Restricted DMA  237.87   133.86   288.28   361.88
  w/ Restricted DMA    256.01   130.95   292.28   353.19

The CPU usage doesn't increase too much either.
Although I didn't measure the CPU usage very precisely, it's ~3% with a single
big core (Cortex-A72) and ~5% with a single small core (Cortex-A53).

Thanks!
