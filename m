dmabounce has only ever been used with specific devices that have weird
setups.  Otherwise, we've never expected what you describe on ARM.  I
also don't recognise your assertion about the way the DMA API should
behave as ever having been documented as a requirement for architectures
to implement.

dmabounce comes with it some serious issues that have been known to
cause OOMs with old kernels (which have never been solved), so that
really isn't the answer.

This kind of breakage that is now being reported is exactly the problem
that I thought would happen with your patches.

32-bit ARM is in maintenance only now, there is no longer any appetite
nor funding for development work on core code.
