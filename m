Right, IOMMU UAPIs are not VFIO specific, we pass user pointer to the IOMMU
layer to process.

Similarly for PASID management, the IOASID extensions we are proposing
will handle ioasid_set (groups/pools), quota, permissions, and notifications
in the IOASID core. There is nothing VFIO specific.

I am not sure what can really be consolidated in /dev/sva. VFIO and VDPA
will have their own kerne-user interfaces anyway for their usage models.
They are just providing the specific transport while sharing generic IOMMU
UAPIs and IOASID management.

As I mentioned PASID management is already consolidated in the IOASID layer,
so for VDPA or other users, it just matter of create its own ioasid_set,
doing allocation.

IOASID is also available to the in-kernel users which does not
need /dev/sva AFAICT. For bare metal SVA, I don't see a need to create this
'floating' state of the PASID when created by /dev/sva. PASID allocation
could happen behind the scene when users need to bind page tables to a
device DMA stream. Security authorization of the PASID is natively enforced
when user try to bind page table, there is no need to pass the FD handle of
the PASID back to the kernel as you suggested earlier.

Thanks,

Jacob
