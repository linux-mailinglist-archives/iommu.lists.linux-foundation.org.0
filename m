hmm, ok, so sounds like it is a combination of what the driver thinks,
and what the bus thinks then?  Ie. the bus should be able to overrule
the driver when it comes to being non-strict.

I'm not sure this sways me one way or another.. even if I compile the
fw myself, I should assume there are bugs.. when it comes to fw, I'm
more interested in how the hw operates and what it has access to and
what the fw can influence.
