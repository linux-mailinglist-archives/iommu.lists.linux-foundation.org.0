I had another look at this, and from some testing, it seems that,
contrary to what the datasheet suggests, the RW (read/write direction)
bit in logged I/O page faults is actually accurate for both faulting
accesses to present pages and faulting accesses to non-present pages.

I made a few hacks to the ixgbe driver to intentionally cause several
different types of I/O page faults, thereby turning an ixgbe NIC into
a poor man's I/O page fault generator, and these are the resulting
logged I/O page faults, on a Ryzen 3700X system:

Read from non-present page:
ixgbe 0000:25:00.1: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0010 address=0x1bbc8f040 flags=0x0000]
=> flags indicate PR(esent)=0, RW=0

Write to non-present page:
ixgbe 0000:25:00.0: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0010 address=0x1bdcb70c0 flags=0x0020]
=> flags indicate PR(esent)=0, RW=1

Read from write-only page:
ixgbe 0000:25:00.1: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0010 address=0xbbcc1c40 flags=0x0050]
=> flags indicate PR(esent)=1, RW=0  (and PE(rmission violation)=1)

Write to read-only page:
ixgbe 0000:25:00.0: AMD-Vi: Event logged [IO_PAGE_FAULT domain=0x0010 address=0xbdcb70c0 flags=0x0070]
=> flags indicate PR(esent)=1, RW=1  (and PE(rmission violation)=1)

In other words, it seems that the RW bit is reliable even for PR=0 type
faults.

I assume that the restriction mentioned in the docs regarding RW and
PR ("RW is only meaningful when PR=1, TR=0, and I=0" from AMD I/O
Virtualization Technology (IOMMU) Specification, revision 3.00, Table
55: IO_PAGE_FAULT Event Log Buffer Entry Fields) is either confused
or refers to a restriction in older hardware that has since been lifted.

I'll resubmit the patch to unconditionally pass through the RW bit.
