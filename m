Given how things have evolved since that code was originally written, 
and that we seemingly now have the def_domain_type override kicking in 
as soon as we first see an IOMMUv2-capable device, do we even need to 
then subsequently switch to this special unmanaged domain with its 
pagetable sucked out, or could we just install the PASID table in the 
default domain itself?
