Hi Robin,

Thank you for the inputs.

I see. But for those cases, they should set seg_boundary_mask in
the drivers, in my opinion, because only they know what hardware
limits are, same as they set dma_mask and coherent_dma_mask.

The reason for I picked dma_mask was because we won't likely hit
the boundary, if it's >= dma_mask -- maybe I am wrong here.

I got a (downstream) bug report from our GPU side. I am not 100%
sure if it's a real world case. But I can't simply ignore -- even
if it's not at this point, sooner or later it'd be.

Not quite getting what could be a user case for non-default mask.
Yet, whoever sets the mask should take the responsibility for any
bad thing happens.

I don't mean DMA API should be blamed for bad thing happening.
Yet, it sets the 32-bit boundary by returning in the get(), so
it's just easier to do the flu-shot in the API; otherwise, we
will end up with patching every single driver. Maybe not quite
a lot at this point, but there will be potentially.

I stated the reason in my first inline reply. But I don't have a
problem for "~0UL", if it feels less confusing to most of people.

And I agree with the concern. Yet we still need to do something,
right? Is there any other value that we may rely on, rather than
dma_mask, even if just for safety? Or would it be possible for us
to warn user when mapping gets out of the given physical address
space, since this is the point when thing goes wrong?

From my point of view, when a device doesn't set dma_params but
uses the default one, it sounds like "I don't have such a limit
in my hardware so you can just give me whatever you can prepare
for me", instead of "I am just a non-absurd case" :)

Overall, I do see a fear of regression for touching the default
segmentation boundary mask. At least I want to see if there can
be anything that we can or will likely do in the future, rather
than adding dma_set_seg_boundary() to all the drivers.

I did send a related bug-reporting email a couple of weeks ago:
https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2020-March/042220.html

Yet have not seen any reply.

Thanks a lot!
