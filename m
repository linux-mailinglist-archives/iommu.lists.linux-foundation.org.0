I really didn't get how this abuse the IOMMU stack.
mdev can be used in 3 different ways:
1. non-iommu backed mdev devices where mdev vendor driver takes care to
DMA map (iommu_map) and isolation is through device hardware internal
MMU. Here vfio_iommu_type1 module provides a way to validate and pin
pages required by mdev device for DMA mapping. Then IOMMU mapping is
done by mdev vendor driver which is owner driver of physical device.

2. iommu backed mdev devices for SRIOV where mdev device is created per
VF (mdev device == VF device) then that mdev device has same iommu
protection scope as VF associated to it. Here mdev device is virtual
device which uses features of mdev and represents underlying VF device,
same as vfio-pci but with additional mdev features.

3. iommu backed mdev devices for PASID with aux feature. I would not
comment on this, there has been a long discussion on this.

I don't think this is abusing IOMMU stack, atleast for 1 and 2 above.

Thanks,
Kirti
