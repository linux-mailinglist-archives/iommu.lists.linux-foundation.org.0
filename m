Probably not, the current usage case has only two PASIDs at most (RID2PASID
+ a kernel PASID).

I was just thinking for the generalized case, device TLB flush would be
more efficient if we don't go through the domain list. Use a per-domain-dev
list instead. But it doesn't matter much for DMA domain which has one
device mostly.

Yes. it would be more efficient for PASID selective domain TLB flush. But
on VT-d IOTLB is also tagged by domain ID, domain flush can use DID if
there are many PASIDs. Not sure about other archs. Agree that optimizing
PASIDs for TLB flush should be a common goal.

yes, at least both VT-d and FSL drivers have struct device_domain_info.

That sounds great to have but not sure i understood correctly how to do it.

Do you mean for each vendor driver's struct device_domain_info (or
equivalent), we carve out sizeof_iommu_dev_pasid_data as common data, then
the rest of the space is vendor specific? I don't feel I get your point,
could you elaborate?


Thanks,

Jacob
