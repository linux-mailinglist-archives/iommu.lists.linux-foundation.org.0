That's giving vfio a lot of credit for influencing VT-d design.

Our current behavior is a reasonable default IMO, but I agree more
control will probably benefit us in the long run.

I'd be tempted to attach it to the -device vfio-pci option, it's
specific drivers for specific devices that are going to want this and
those devices may not be permanently attached to the VM.  But I see in
the other thread you're trying to optimize IOMMU page table sharing.

There's a usability question in either case though and I'm not sure how
to get around it other than QEMU or the kernel knowing a list of
devices (explicit IDs or vendor+class) to select per device defaults.

Could you clarify "vfio_driver"?  The existing vfio-pci driver can't
know this, beyond perhaps probing if the Enable No-snoop bit is
hardwired to zero.  It's the driver running on top of vfio that
ultimately controls whether a capable device actually issues no-snoop
TLPs, but that can't be known to us.  A vendor variant of vfio-pci
might certainly know more about how its device is used by those
userspace/VM drivers.  Thanks,

Alex
