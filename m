Guess we do need to understand a little bit better how the USB DART
actually works.  My hypothesis (based on our discussion on #asahi) is
that the XHCI host controller and the peripheral controller of the
DWC3 block use different DMA "streams" that are handled by the
different sub-DARTs.

The Corellium folks use a DART + sub-DART model in their driver and a
single node in the device tree that represents both.  That might sense
since the error registers and interrupts are shared.  Maybe it would
make sense to select the appropriate sub-DART based on the DMA stream
ID?

Ah, missed those.

Doesn't sound like a very good idea to me to repurpose "ranges" for
this...

That sounds like a serious contender to me!  Hopefully one of the
Linux kernel developers can give this some sort of blessing.

I think it would make sense for us to just rely on the #address-cells
and #size-cells defaults for the M1 device tree.
