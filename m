Sure, we don't need to try to tackle every problem at once, a map/unmap
interface compatible with what we have is a good place to start and
nested translation may provide the high performance option.  That's not
to say that we couldn't, in the future, extend the map/unmap with memory
pre-registration like done in the spapr IOMMU to see how that could
reduce latency.

The IOMMU API doesn't currently support those semantics.  If the IOMMU
used a superpage, then a superpage gets unmapped, it doesn't get
atomically broken down into smaller pages.  Therefore virtio-mem
proposes a fixed mapping granularity to allow for that same unmapping
granularity.

Currently if userspace wants to guarantee unmap granularity, they need
to make the same restriction themselves on the mapping granularity.
For instance, userspace cannot currently map a 1GB IOVA range while
guaranteeing 2MB unmap granularity of that range with a single ioctl.
Instead userspace would need to make 512, 2MB mappings calls.

We had tossed around an idea of a super-container with vfio, it's maybe
something we'd want to incorporate into this design.  For instance, if
memory could be pre-registered with a super container, which would
handle the locked memory accounting for that memory, then
sub-containers could all handle the IOMMU context of their sets of
devices relative to that common memory pool.

Things like I note above, userspace cannot currently specify mapping
granularity nor has any visibility to the granularity they get from the
IOMMU.  What actually happens in the IOMMU is pretty opaque to the user
currently.  Thanks,

Alex
