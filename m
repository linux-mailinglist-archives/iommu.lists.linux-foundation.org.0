Yes it's not just because of SMMU. Now I understand that we indeed need
to shutdown SMMU like any other driver and we need to fix the client
drivers as well.

This would be good, however this would then mask the fact that it is
client drivers who are buggy and if we stop seeing issues, then no one
will bother fixing the client drivers. So we better go ahead and fix
the client drivers first and I will drop this patch.

Not a problem, I wanted to confirm if kexec issue was indeed only due to
client driver bugs or SMMU has also some contribution. We have already
started adding client driver shutdown callbacks [1][2], but I also
wanted to get this clarified, so sent this patch as RFC.
