So, there are some questions about the VIOT definition and I just
don't know enough to be able to answer them.  One of the ASWG members
is trying to understand the semantics behind the subtables.

Is there a particular set of people, or mailing lists, that I can
point to to get the questions answered?  Ideally it would be one
of the public lists where it has already been discussed, but an
individual would be fine, too.  No changes have been proposed, just
some questions asked.

Thanks.
