VT-d also results in unrecoverable fault for a cleared PASID. I am
assuming in the fault record, SMMU can also identify the PASID and
source ID. So that should be able to find the matching mm.
Then you can check if the mm is defunct?

I agree. I looked at the code, it is much more clean with the
mmu_notifier_get/put.

I am thinking perhaps adding a reclaim mechanism such that IOASID not
directly freed can stay in an in_active list (while waiting for its
states get cleared) until it can be reclaimed. Do you see this is
useful for SMMU?

This is useful for VT-d, since we have more consumers for a given PASID,
i.e. VMCS, VDCM, and IOMMU. Each consumer has its own PASID context to
clean up.

Thanks for the explanation!
