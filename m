You are right, I guess it makes sense to keep a 32-bit zone as not all
devices would be described as such.

Maybe this one is still worth fixing, at least for consistency. But it's
not urgent.

My diff above has a side-effect that if dt_zone_dma_bits is below the
start of DRAM, ZONE_DMA gets expanded to PHYS_ADDR_MAX. If this was
32-bit, that's fine but if it was, say, 30-bit because of some firmware
misdescription with RAM starting at 2GB, we end up with no ZONE_DMA32. I
think max_zone_phys() could cap this at 32, as a safety mechanism:

static phys_addr_t __init max_zone_phys(unsigned int zone_bits)
{
	phys_addr_t zone_mask = (1ULL << zone_bits) - 1;
	phys_addr_t phys_start = memblock_start_of_DRAM();

	if (!(phys_start & U32_MAX))
		zone_mask = PHYS_ADDR_MAX;
	else if (!(phys_start & zone_mask))
		zone_mask = U32_MAX;

	return min(zone_mask + 1, memblock_end_of_DRAM());
}

Assuming I got the shifting right, arm64_dma_phys_limit becomes:

 	arm64_dma_phys_limit = max_zone_phys(zone_dma_bits, 32);
