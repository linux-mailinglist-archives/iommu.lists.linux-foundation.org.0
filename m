I agree with you Christoph, users want page based api, which is useful
in many scenarios, but
As of now i think we have to move with this type of api which is
useful when dma_alloc (for cma )call with DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING,
and mapped again to kernel space, this api is useful mostly for 32-bit
system which has 4GB of limited virtual memory (its very less for
android devices) as we have already dma_mmap_attr() for user space
mapping.
This api is also useful for one who directly want to use cma_alloc()
in their own drivers. For example ion-cma.c.
Please let me know if any recommendation/suggestion/improvement required ?

Pankaj
