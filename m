Thanks for the information.

While from the code comment around which atomic pool is requested,
on amd system it's used to satisfy decrypting memory because that
can't block. Combined with your saying, it's because NVMe driver
need decrypted memory on AMD system? 

void *dma_direct_alloc(struct device *dev, size_t size,
                dma_addr_t *dma_handle, gfp_t gfp, unsigned long attrs)
{
	......
        /*
         * Remapping or decrypting memory may block. If either is required and
         * we can't block, allocate the memory from the atomic pools.
         */
        if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_DMA_COHERENT_POOL) &&
            !gfpflags_allow_blocking(gfp) &&
            (force_dma_unencrypted(dev) ||
             (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_DMA_DIRECT_REMAP) && !dev_is_dma_coherent(dev))))
                return dma_direct_alloc_from_pool(dev, size, dma_handle, gfp);
	......
}

Looking at the those related commits, the below one from David tells 
that atomic dma pool is used when device require non-blocking and
unencrypted buffer. When I checked the system I borrowed, it's AMD EYPC
and SME is enabled. And it has many pci devices, as you can see, its 'ls
pci' outputs 113 lines. But disabling the three atomic pools didn't
trigger any error on that AMD system. Does it mean only specific devices
need this atomic pool in SME/SEV enabling case? Should we add more
details in document or code comment to make clear this? 

commit 82fef0ad811fb5976cf36ccc3d2c3bc0195dfb72
Author: David Rientjes <rientjes@google.com>
Date:   Tue Apr 14 17:05:01 2020 -0700

    x86/mm: unencrypted non-blocking DMA allocations use coherent pools
    
    When CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT is enabled and a device requires unencrypted
    DMA, all non-blocking allocations must originate from the atomic DMA
    coherent pools.
    
    Select CONFIG_DMA_COHERENT_POOL for CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT.
