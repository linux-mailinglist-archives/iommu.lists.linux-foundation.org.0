Ha, I'd also resurrected this and was planning to post it at some point 
this week[0] - you should have said :)

Actually it only needs a general MMU-600 compatible, since once you know 
it's an Arm Ltd. implementation, you can assume the pattern for the 
IMP_DEF ID registers to figure out the rest.
