I don't think presence or absence of a group fd makes a lot of
difference to this design.  Having a group fd just means we attach
groups to the ioasid instead of individual devices, and we no longer
need the bookkeeping of "partial" devices.

Right.  I'd assume that for compatibility, creating a container would
create a single IOASID under the hood with a compatiblity layer
translating the container operations to iosaid operations.

Again, I don't think it makes much difference.  The model doesn't
really change even if you allow both ATTACH_GROUP and ATTACH_DEVICE on
the IOASID.  Basically ATTACH_GROUP would just be equivalent to
attaching all the constituent devices.
