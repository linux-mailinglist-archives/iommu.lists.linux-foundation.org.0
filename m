The IOMMU is probably your friend here - one thing that might be worth 
trying is capturing the iommu:map and iommu:unmap tracepoints to see if 
the address reported in subsequent IOMMU faults was previously mapped as 
a valid DMA address (be warned that there will likely be a *lot* of 
trace generated). With 5.13 or newer, booting with "iommu.forcedac=1" 
should also make it easier to tell real DMA IOVAs from rogue physical 
addresses or other nonsense, as real DMA addresses should then look more 
like 0xffff24d08000.

That could at least help narrow down whether it's some kind of 
use-after-free race or a completely bogus address creeping in somehow.

Robin.
