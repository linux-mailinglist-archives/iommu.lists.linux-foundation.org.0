I do understand there is a tradeoff between performance and isolation. However, users might ask for performance while supporting isolation. 
In passthrough mode, the whole memory might be accessible by DMA. In non-strict mode, a buffer could be still mapped in IOMMU when users have returned it to buddy and the buffer has even been allocated by another user.

lower-layer drivers maintain some reusable coherent buffers.
For TX path, drivers copy streaming buffer to coherent buffer, then do DMA;
For RX path, drivers do DMA in coherent buffer, then copy to streaming buffer.

Yes, indeed. Hopefully the small set of specific circumstances will encourage more upper-layer consumers to reuse buffers, then the "reusable" flag can extend to more common cases, such as page and single buffer.

Absolutely agree. I didn't say the method is elegant. For this moment, maybe "reuse" can get started from a small case like zswap. After some while, it is possible more users are encouraged to do some optimization for buffer reuse, understanding the suffering of lower-layer drivers. Then those performance problems might be solved case by case.
On the other hand, it is always the freedom of upper-layer code to indicate "reuse" or not. If they don't say anything about reuse, lower-layer drivers can simply do map and unmap.

are the buffer pools for RX path? For TX path, buffers come from upper-layer so network drivers can't do anything for recycling SKBs?
