I think this is going to require at least some degree of cooperation
=66rom the bootloader. See my other thread on that. Unfortunately I think
this is an area where everyone has kind of been doing their own thing
even if standard bindings for this have been around for quite a while
(actually 5 years by now). I suspect that most bootloaders that run
today are not that old, but as always downstream doesn't follow closely
where upstream is guiding.

The proper solution, I think, is for bootloader and kernel to work
together. Unfortunately that means we'll just have to bite the bullet
and get things fixed across the stack. I think this is just the latest
manifestation of the catch-up that upstream has been playing. Only now
that we're starting to enable all of these features upstream are we
running into interoperability issues.

If upstream had been further along we would've caught these issues way
ahead of time and could've influenced the designs of bootloader much
earlier. Now, unless we get all the vendors to go back and modify 5 year
old code that's going to be difficult.

However, I think Robin has a point here: it's clearly documented in the
boot protocol, so technically bootloaders are buggy and we can't always
go and fix things so that buggy bootloaders continue to work. There's
not a whole lot of incentive for anyone to fix the bootloaders if we
keep doing that, ey?

I've been thinking, though, and I'm not sure I see this issue on newer
Tegras that use the ARM SMMU. I suppose this could be because the
bootloader doesn't enable the SMMU, but then again, I should be getting
these faults even so. Interestingly I don't see those on 64-bit ARM, so
perhaps there's something special about that.

Let me reload a bit of context here so I can give you more than just
speculation.
