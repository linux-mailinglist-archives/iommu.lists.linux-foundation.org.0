Hi Robin,

Just wondering if you had made any progress on your FQ code rework or 
your own re-org?

I wasn't planning on progressing 
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-iommu/1626259003-201303-1-git-send-email-john.garry@huawei.com/ 
until this is done first (and that is still a big issue), even though 
not strictly necessary.

Thanks,
John
