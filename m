Sorry for the late reply. Got caught up on other work.

I didn't think the SMMU itself was PCI based in the example Jean gave.
I thought it just happened to be the case where the SMMU probes after
the pcieport but before the other children. If the SMMU itself is a
child of the pcieport, how can it be required for the parent to
function? How will suspend/resume even work?! I feel like I'm missing
some context wrt to PCI that everyone else seems to know (which isn't
surprising).

Worry about child devices in what sense? From a non-iommu perspective?
