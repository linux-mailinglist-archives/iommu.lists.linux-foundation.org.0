So I'm not entirely clear here if you're envisaging putting the device
into no-DMA mode by altering the IOMMU setup or by quiescing it at the
register level (e.g. by resetting it).  But, neither approach allows
you to safely put a device into no-DMA mode if users have access to
another device in the group.

The IOMMU approach doesn't work, because the IOMMU may not be able to
distinguish the two devices from each other.

The register approach doesn't work, because even if you successfully
quiesce the device, the user could poke it indirectly via the other
device in the group, pulling it out of quiescent mode.

A whole group has to be in the same DMA context at the same time.
That's the definition of a group.
