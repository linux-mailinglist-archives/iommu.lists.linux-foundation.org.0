Where is this being worked on?  I see no open tickets for this.

This is not really an answer to the question.  The latest version of the
IORT RMR spec was published in Feb 2021. Why was this issue not
brought up with Rev 1 of this patchset? Instead you have wasted
10 months of developer and customer time. This could have easily been
turned into a code first spec change request, which is a valid option
for ACPI changes.

Every month that this patchset has sat being unattended by the
maintainers is another kernel dev cycle missed, it is another
another distribution release where users need to add hackish
kernel command-line options to disable security features that
were forced on by default. Not to mention Linux is just one
platform. What if other platforms have already adopted the
existing spec? These are Arm specs and Arm maintainers and
yet nobody seems to agree on anything and absolutely nothing
has been achieved except wasting the time of Shameer, myself,
our companies, and our customers.
