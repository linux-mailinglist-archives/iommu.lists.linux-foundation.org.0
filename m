When using ENQCMD the PASID that needs to be sent on the wire is picked
from an MSR setup by kernel. This is context switched along with the
process. So each process has only 1 PASID that can go out when using
ENQCMD. ENQCMD takes one mmio address specific to the acclerator and a
source for the descriptor. 

When one application is connecting to more than one accelerator since this
is MSR based filled in by the cpu instruction automaticaly requires both
accelerators to use the same PASID. 

Did you refer to this implementation? or something else?

True, but when we have guest using vSVM, and enabling vENQCMD the
requirement is the same inside a guest.

The difficult part I see is, when one application establishes a path to one
acclerator, we have no knowledge if its going to connect to a second, third 
or such. I don't see how this can work reasonably well. What if PASIDx is allocated
for one, but the second RID its trying to attach already has this
PASID allocated?

Correct, but how does guest through vIOMMU driver communicate that intent so uAPI
plumbing can do this? I mean architecturally via IOMMU interfaces?
