The point is really whether we want to revert changes in Linux that
made both DT and ACPI boot work without quirks on RPi4. Having to
check the RPi4 compatible string or OEM id in core init code is awful,
regardless of whether you boot via ACPI or via DT.

The problem with this hardware is that it uses a DMA mask which is
narrower than 32, and the arm64 kernel is simply not set up to deal
with that at all. On DT, we have DMA ranges properties and the likes
to describe such limitations, on ACPI we have _DMA methods as well as
DMA range attributes in the IORT, both of which are now handled
correctly. So all the information is there, we just have to figure out
how to consume it early on.

Interestingly, this limitation always existed in the SoC, but it
wasn't until they started shipping it with more than 1 GB of DRAM that
it became a problem. This means issues like this could resurface in
the future with existing SoCs when they get shipped with more memory,
and so I would prefer fixing this in a generic way.

Also, I assume papering over the issue like this does not fix the
kdump issue fundamentally, it just works around it, and so we might
run into this again in the future.
