Okay, so it sounds like we effectively have four 4G address spaces and
we can assign the master devices to them. I guess each of these
address spaces makes for an IOMMU group.

It's fine to pre-assign the devices to those groups for now, but it
definitely shouldn't be hardcoded in DT, because it depends on the use
case of the device. I'll take a look at v6, but it sounds like it
should be fine if it doesn't take the address space assignment from DT
anymore.

From the practical point of view, it doesn't look like setting this on
a per-larb basis would make much sense. The reason to switch the
bank_sel would be to decide which MM devices can share the same
address space. This is a security aspect, because it effectively
determines which devices are isolated from each other.

That said, I agree that for now we can just start with a fixed
assignment. We can think of the API if there is a need to adjust the
assignment.

Actually, is the current assignment correct?

domain-id  module     iova-range                  larbs
   0       disp        0 ~ 4G                      larb0/1
   1       vcodec      4G ~ 8G                     larb4/5/7
   2       cam/mdp     8G ~ 12G             larb2/9/11/13/14/16/17/18/19/20
   3       CCU0    0x4000_0000 ~ 0x43ff_ffff     larb13: port 9/10
   4       CCU1    0x4400_0000 ~ 0x47ff_ffff     larb14: port 4/5

Wouldn't CCU0 and CCU1 conflict with disp? Should perhaps disp be
assigned 12G ~ 16G instead?
