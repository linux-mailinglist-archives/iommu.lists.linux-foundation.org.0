It may not have been well-documented at the time, but this was largely 
intentional. The assumption based on known systems was that where 
dma_pfn_offset existed, it would *not* apply to peer MMIO addresses.

For instance, DTs for TI Keystone 2 platforms only describe an offset 
for RAM:

	dma-ranges = <0x80000000 0x8 0x00000000 0x80000000>;

but a DMA controller might also want to access something in the MMIO 
range 0x0-0x7fffffff, of which it still has an identical non-offset 
view. If a driver was previously using dma_map_resource() for that, it 
would now start getting DMA_MAPPING_ERROR because the dma_range_map 
exists but doesn't describe the MMIO region. I agree that in hindsight 
it's not an ideal situation, but it's how things have ended up, so at 
this point I'm wary of making potentially-breaking changes.

May I ask what exactly your setup looks like, if you have a DMA 
controller with an offset view of its "own" MMIO space?

Thanks,
Robin.
