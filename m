We are checking internally whether this assumption makes sense at
least for Intel devices which are PASID-capable.

Curious how failover could be triggered in your mind. It's easy to
detect conflict with other PCI caps, but not for conflict with hidden
registers. The latter can be identified only with device specific
knowledge. Possibly in the end we may leverage Yan's vendor ops to 
find a safe location...

I suppose such packed design is mostly for PF. Ideally VF is much simpler
and the requirement of hidden registers should be much fewer. Otherwise
even using same PF offset doesn't work. Long-term it is better for PCISIG
to add some recommendations, e.g. for capabilities that are shared 
between PF/VF, VF config space should still reserve a range at the same 
location/size as of the PF ones.

Thanks
