The max number of processes can be limited for a user. PASID is per
address space so the max number of PASID can be limited for the user.
So the user cannot exhaust PASID so easily, right?

Intel ENQCMD instruction uses PASID MSR to store the PASID. Each software
thread can store the PASID in its own MSR/fpu state.

If free PASID in unbind_mm(), the threads PASID MSRs need to be cleared
as well: tracking which thread has the MSR set up, searching the threads,
sending IPIs to the thread to clear the MSR, locking, etc. It's doable but
complex with low performance.

Binding the PASID to the mm and freeing the PASID in __mmdrop() can get
ride of the complexity.

Thanks.
