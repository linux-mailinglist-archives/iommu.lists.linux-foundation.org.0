Will do. I plan to document this in a kernel doc for IOASID/PASID
lifecycle management.

For VT-d, a PASID can be used by VFIO, IOMMU driver, KVM, and Virtual
Device Composition Module (VDCM*) at the same time.

*https://software.intel.com/en-us/download/intel-data-streaming-accelerator-preliminary-architecture-specification

There are HW context associated with the PASID in IOMMU, KVM, and VDCM.
So before the lifetime of the PASID is over, clean up must be done in
all of the above. PASID cannot be reclaimed until the last user drops
its reference. Our plan is to do notification and refcouting.

Agreed. We are adding many new features and converging with generic
sva_bind_device. Things will get more clear after we have fewer moving
pieces.
