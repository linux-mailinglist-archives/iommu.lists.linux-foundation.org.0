Here the aim is not to find the device/groups maps, but to dump CD/STE value.
Of cause, we can know them from reading codes, however, we expect to dump
hardware configures quickly and directly when debugging hardware related
problem. It is a real pain when your hardware guy ask you to do this :)

Do you mean different page-table format, like 64_s1, 64_s2, 32_s1, 32_s2?
Seems in io-pgtable code, we only tell them in arm_lpae_prot_to_pte, and
currently in this RFC patch, we do not print attributes.

Thanks,
