Hmm, I had a look at v6 and it still has the address spaces hardcoded
in the DTS. Could we move the fixed assignment to the MTK IOMMU driver
code instead, so that it can be easily adjusted as the kernel code
evolves without the need to update the DTS?

That's exactly why I proposed to have the API operate based on the
struct device, rather than individual DMA ports. Although I guess the
CCU case is different, because it's the same larb as the camera.

Anyway, I agree that we don't have to come up with such an API right now.

Indeed, space is not a problem, but from the security point of view
it's undesirable. I believe CCU would be running proprietary firmware,
so it should be isolated as much as possible from other components.
And, after all, why waste the remaining 4G of address space?
