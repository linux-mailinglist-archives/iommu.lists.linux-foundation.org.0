I agree this can slow down CPU, but not as much as IO page fault.

On the other hand, wouldn't it be the benefit of hardware accelerators
to have a lower and more stable latency zip/encryption than CPU?

Yes. It is true SVA not emulated SVA.

Absolutely I agree improving IOPF and making IOPF catch up with the 
performance of page fault is the best way. but it would take much
long time to optimize both HW and SW. While waiting for them to
mature, probably some way which can minimize IOPF should be used to
take the responsivity.
