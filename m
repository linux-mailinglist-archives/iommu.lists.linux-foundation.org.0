Communicates to whom?

The only thing we know about the device is whether or not Enable
No-snoop is hard wired to zero, ie. it either can't generate no-snoop
TLPs ("coherent-only") or it might ("assumed non-coherent").  If
we're putting the policy decision in the hands of userspace they should
have access to wbinvd if they own a device that is assumed
non-coherent AND it's attached to an IOMMU (page table) that is not
blocking no-snoop (a "non-coherent IOASID").

I think that means that the IOASID needs to be created (IOASID_ALLOC)
with a flag that specifies whether this address space is coherent
(IOASID_GET_INFO probably needs a flag/cap to expose if the system
supports this).  All mappings in this IOASID would use IOMMU_CACHE and
and devices attached to it would be required to be backed by an IOMMU
capable of IOMMU_CAP_CACHE_COHERENCY (attach fails otherwise).  If only
these IOASIDs exist, access to wbinvd would not be provided.  (How does
a user provided page table work? - reserved bit set, user error?)

Conversely, a user could create a non-coherent IOASID and attach any
device to it, regardless of IOMMU backing capabilities.  Only if an
assumed non-coherent device is attached would the wbinvd be allowed.

I think that means that an EXECUTE_WBINVD ioctl lives on the IOASIDFD
and the IOASID world needs to understand the device's ability to
generate non-coherent DMA.  This wbinvd ioctl would be a no-op (or
some known errno) unless a non-coherent IOASID exists with a potentially
non-coherent device attached.

In my model above, the IOASID is central to this.

Right, and in the new world order, vfio is only a device driver, the
IOASID manages the device's DMA.  wbinvd is only necessary relative to
non-coherent DMA, which seems like QEMU needs to bump KVM with an
ioasidfd.

What do you imagine is the use case for totally blocking wbinvd?  In
the model I describe, wbinvd would always be a no-op/known-errno when
the IOASIDs are all allocated as coherent or a non-coherent IOASID has
only coherent-only devices attached.  Does userspace need a way to
prevent itself from scenarios where wbvind is not a no-op?

In general I'm having trouble wrapping my brain around the semantics of
the enable/automatic/force-disable wbinvd specific proposal, sorry.
Thanks,

Alex
