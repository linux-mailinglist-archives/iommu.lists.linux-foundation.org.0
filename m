I don't think that's absolutely true.  By the same logic, we could say
that pci-sysfs provides access to PCI BAR and config space resources,
the VFIO device interface duplicates part of that interface therefore it
should be abandoned.  But in reality, VFIO providing access to those
resources puts those accesses within the scope and control of the VFIO
interface.  Ownership of a device through vfio is provided by allowing
the user access to the vfio group dev file, not by the group file, plus
some number of resource files, and the config file, and running with
admin permissions to see the full extent of config space.  Reserved
ranges for the IOMMU are also provided via sysfs, but VFIO includes a
capability on the IOMMU get_info ioctl for the user to learn about
available IOVA ranges w/o scraping through sysfs.

AIUI, that doesn't exist yet, so it makes sense that VFIO, as the
mechanism through which a user would allocate a PASID, implements a
reasonable quota to avoid an unprivileged user exhausting the address
space.  Also, "unprivileged user" is a bit of a misnomer in this
context as the VFIO user must be privileged with ownership of a device
before they can even participate in PASID allocation.  Is truly
unprivileged access reasonable for a limited resource?

QEMU typically runs in a sandbox with limited access, when a device or
mdev is assigned to a VM, file permissions are configured to allow that
access.  QEMU doesn't get to poke at any random dev file it likes,
that's part of how userspace reduces the potential attack surface.

This series is a blueprint within the context of the ownership and
permission model that VFIO already provides.  It doesn't seem like we
can pluck that out on its own, nor is it necessarily the case that VFIO
wouldn't want to provide PASID services within its own API even if we
did have this undefined /dev/sva interface.  Thanks,

Alex
