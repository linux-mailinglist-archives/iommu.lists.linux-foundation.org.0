I looked at this and immediately thought "surely the compiler can see 
that all the prod/cons/val fields are written anyway and elide the 
initialisation?", so I dumped the before and after disassembly, and... oh.

You should probably clarify that it's zero-initialising all the 
cacheline padding which is both pointless and painful. With that,

Reviewed-by: Robin Murphy <robin.murphy@arm.com>

However, having looked this closely I'm now tangentially wondering why 
max_n_shift isn't inside the padded union? It's read at the same time as 
both prod and cons by queue_has_space(), and never updated, so there 
doesn't appear to be any benefit to it being in a separate cacheline all 
by itself, and llq is already twice as big as it needs to be. Sorting 
that would also be a good opportunity to store the value of interest in 
its appropriate form so we're not needlessly recalculating 1 << shift 
every flippin' time...

Robin.
