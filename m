Clear to me now. Thanks for explanation. :-)

Changing default domain through sysfs requires the users to ubind any
driver from the devices in the group. There's a check code and return
failure if this requirement doesn't meet.

So we only need to consider the device release path. device_lock(dev) is
used in this patch to guarantee that no device release happens at the
same time.

I searched the code. The exynos is the only case that inspects
group->default_domain without holding the mutex during run time. It's in
the device release path, so I think it's safe.

Yes. Thanks!
