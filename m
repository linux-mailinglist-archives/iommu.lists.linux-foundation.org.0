Oh, sure, I'm not saying we definitely don't need to fix anything, I'd 
just like to get a better understanding of *what* we're fixing. I'd have 
(naively) expected the mm layer to give us page-aligned quantities even 
in the SVA notifier case, so if we've got a clear off-by-one somewhere 
in that path we should fix that before just blindly over-invalidating to 
paper over it; if we still also want to be robust at the SMMU driver end 
just in case, something like "if (WARN_ON(num_pages == 0)) num_pages = 
1;" might be more appropriate. However if it turns out that we *can* 
actually end up with unsanitised input from some userspace unmap 
interface getting this far, then a silent fixup is the best option, but 
if so I'd still like to confirm that we're rounding in the same 
direction as whoever touched the pagetables (since it can't have been us).

Thanks,
Robin.
