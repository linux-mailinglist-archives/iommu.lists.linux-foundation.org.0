So should there be an error case if there isn't an "old" state, and
the user calls:

	p = begin_update_one_xsave_feature(XFEATURE_something, false);

Maybe instead of an error, just fill it in with the init state for the feature?

Ok - those seem ok ... it is up to the caller to make sure that the
target task is in some "not running, and can't suddenly start running"
state before calling these functions.

Nice guys waste CPU cycles writing to memory that is just going to get
written again.

Like this?

	if (tsk == current) {
		switch (xfeature) {
		case XFEATURE_PKRU:
			*(u32 *)addr = rdpkru();
			break;
		case XFEATURE_PASID:
			rdmsrl(MSR_IA32_PASID, msr);
			*(u64 *)addr = msr;
			break;
		... any other "easy" states ...
		default:
			xsaves(xstate, 1 << xfeature);
			break;
		}
	}

Begin? End? It's all inside fpregs_lock(). But whatever seems best.

Yes, I think that this means set XSTATE_BV[feature] ... but I'm
relying on you as the xsave expert to help get the subtle bits right so
the Andy Lutomirski can smile at this code.

Yes, that's the TIF bit my pseudo-code intended.

Only makes sense if "tsk == current". But does this help. The work seems
to be the same whether we do it now, or later. We don't know for sure
that we will directly return to the task. We might context switch to
another task, so loading the state into registers now would just be
wasted time.
