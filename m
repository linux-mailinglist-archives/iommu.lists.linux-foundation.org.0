I don't think that we should just altogether avoid logging the subset
of page faults for which we can't determine the read/write direction
on AMD platforms.

E.g. "access to an unmapped address" (which will have PR=0, and thus we
won't know if it was a read or a write access) is just as much of a page
fault as "write to a read-only page" (which will have PR=1, and thus the
RW bit will be accurate) is, and for RAS purposes, both events are
equally interesting, and important to know about.

It's true that we currently don't have a way of signaling to
report_iommu_fault() (and by extension, to the io_page_fault
tracepoint) that we're not sure whether the offending access was a read
or a write, but I think we can just add a bit to include/linux/iommu.h
to indicate that, something along the lines of:

	 /* iommu fault flags */
	 #define IOMMU_FAULT_READ        0x0
	 #define IOMMU_FAULT_WRITE       0x1
	+#define IOMMU_FAULT_RW_UNKNOWN  0x2

(Cc'ing Ohad Ben-Cohen, who originally added this API.)

I don't think that it would be a good idea to just not signal the page
faults for which we don't know the read/write direction.


Thanks,
Lennert
