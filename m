This wait-for-safe is a TLB invalidation enhancement to help display
and camera devices.
The SMMU hardware throttles the invalidations so that clients such as
display and camera can indicate when to start the invalidation.
So the SMMU essentially reduces the rate at which invalidations are
serviced from its queue. This also throttles the invalidations from
other masters too.

On sdm845, the software is expected to serialize the invalidation
command loading into SMMU invalidation FIFO using hardware locks
(downstream code [2]), and is also expected to throttle non-real time
clients while waiting for SAFE==1 (downstream code[2]). We don't do
any of these yet, and as per my understanding as this wait-for-safe is
enabled by the bootloader in a one time config, this logic reduces
performance of devices such as usb and ufs.

There's isn't any downside from disabling this logic until we have all
the pieces together from downstream in upstream kernels, and until we
have sdm845 devices that are running with full display/gfx stack
running. That's when we plan to revisit this and enable all the pieces
to get display and USB/UFS working with their optimum performance.
