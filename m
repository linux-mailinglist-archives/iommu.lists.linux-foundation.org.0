Not sure how you had this played out.. For PASID used in ENQCMD today for
our SVM usages, we *DO* not automatically propagate or allocate new PASIDs. 

The new process needs to bind to get a PASID for its own use. For threads
of same process the PASID is inherited. For forks(), we do not
auto-allocate them. Since PASID isn't a sharable resource much like how you
would not pass mmio mmap's to forked processes that cannot be shared correct?
Such as your doorbell space for e.g.

Feels like you can simply avoid the PASID DOS rather than permit it to
happen.

Good, so there is no new requirements here I suppose.

This is one of those things that I would disagree and commit :-)..

Looks like now we are getting closer to what we need. :-)

Given that PASID api's are general purpose today and any driver can use it
to take advantage. VFIO fortunately or unfortunately has the IOMMU things
abstracted. I suppose that support is also mostly built on top of the
generic iommu* api abstractions in a vendor neutral way? 

I'm still lost on what is missing that vDPA can't build on top of what is
available?

Cheers,
Ashok
