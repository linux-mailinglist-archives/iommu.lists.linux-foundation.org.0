I think you're going to need to redefine iommu_iova_to_phys() and fix
all the IOMMU implementations of it to comply.  Currently AMD and Intel
IOMMU driver return zero if a mapping is not found.  You could make the
function return 0/errno and return the physical address via a pointer
arg.  You could also keep the existing definition, but introduce a test
for a valid result that might use an architecture specific value (akin
to IS_ERR()).  You could also just reserve the zero page from userspace
allocation.  I really don't want #ifdef in the vfio iommu driver trying
to discern the correct invalid value though.  Thanks,

Alex
