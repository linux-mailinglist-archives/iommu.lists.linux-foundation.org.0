I'm not so worried about the 1M limitation, but it obviously makes sense
to avoid that because allocating stuff which is not used is pointless in
general.

Exactly.

Which is simple and makes a lot of sense. See below.

I'm not seeing that as a realistic problem. Applications which use this
kind of devices are unlikely to behave exactly that way.

2^20 PASIDs are really plenty and just adding code for the theoretical
case of PASID pressure is a pointless exercise IMO. It just adds
complexity for no reason.

IMO reality will be that either you have long lived processes with tons
of threads which use such devices over and over or short lived forked
processes which open the device, do the job, close and exit. Both
scenarios are fine with allocate on first use and drop on process exit.

I think with your approach you create overhead for applications which
use thread pools where the threads get work thrown at them and do open()
-> do_stuff() -> close() and then go back to wait for the next job which
will do exactly the same thing. So you add the overhead of refcounts in
general and in the worst case if the refcount drops to zero then the
next worker has to allocate a new PASID instead of just moving on.

So unless you have a really compelling real world usecase argument, I'm
arguing that the PASID pressure problem is a purely academic exercise.

I think you are conflating two things here:

  1) PASID lifetime
  2) PASID MSR overhead

Which is not correct: You still can and have to optimize the per thread
behaviour vs. the PASID MSR: Track per thread whether it ever needed the
PASID and act upon that.

If the thread just does EMQCMD once in it's lifetime, then so be
it. That's not a realistic use case, really.

And if someone does this then this does not mean we have to optimize for
that. Optimizing for possible stupid implementations is the wrong
approach. There is no technial measure against stupidity. If that would
exist the world would be a much better place.

You really have to think about the problem space you are working
on. There are problems which need a 'get it right at the first shot'
solution because they create user space ABI or otheer hard to fix
dependencies.

That's absolutely not the case here.

Get the basic simple support correct and work from there. Trying to
solve all possible theoretical problems upfront is simply not possible
and a guarantee for not making progress.

"Keep it simple" and "correctness first" are still the best working
engineering principles.

They do not prevent us from revisiting this _if_ there is a real world
problem which makes enough sense to implement a finer grained solution.

Thanks,

        tglx
