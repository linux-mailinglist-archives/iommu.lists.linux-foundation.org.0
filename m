Normally a hardware bug/quirk is identified during boot. For above case,
iommu core should put these two devices in a same iommu_group during
iommu_probe_device() phase. Any runtime hardware bug should be reported
to the OS through various methods so that the device could be quiet
and isolated. I don't think two devices could be in different groups
initially and then be moved to a single one.
