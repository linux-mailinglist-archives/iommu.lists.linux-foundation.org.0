Yup, pretty much that, except don't bother with IOMMU_NOEXEC. We can't 
reliably infer it - e.g. on an AXI-based interconnect AxCACHE and AxPROT 
are entirely orthogonal, so a Device-type read with the "Instruction 
access" hint is perfectly legal - and in the common IORT code we're not 
in a position to second-guess what any given RMR might represent for 
whatever agent is accessing it.

All we can reasonably do here is map the Device types to IOMMU_MMIO and 
Write-back to IOMMU_CACHE, and if anyone ever does want to insist that 
that's not sufficient, then they're welcome to send patches to make the 
IOMMU API more expressive :)

Yes, exactly!

Cheers,
