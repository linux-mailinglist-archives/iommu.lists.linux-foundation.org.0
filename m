I agree with this plan (provided I understood it correctly this time):
have IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_IOPF describing the IOPF interface between device and
IOMMU. Enabling it on its own doesn't do anything visible to the driver,
it just probes for capabilities and enables PRI if necessary. For host
SVA, since there is no additional communication between IOMMU and device
driver, enabling IOMMU_DEV_FEAT_SVA in addition to IOPF is sufficient.
Then when implementing nested we'll extend iommu_register_fault_handler()
with flags and parameters. That will also enable advanced dispatching (1).

Will it be necessary to enable FEAT_IOPF when doing VFIO passthrough
(injecting to the guest or handling it with external page tables)?
I think that would be better. Currently a device driver registering a
fault handler doesn't know if it will get recoverable page faults or only
unrecoverable ones.

So I don't think this patch needs any change. Baolu, are you ok with
keeping this and patch 4?

Thanks,
Jean
