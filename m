Guys I have lost you honestly. I don't understand what you really need
to do with DT and ACPI here. Are they needed to describe what you need
or not ? If the MC dma configure function does not need any DT/ACPI
bindings that's fine by me, I don't understand though why you are still
asking how to represent MC in ACPI then, what for.

Can you talk between *yourselves* please and decide what you need ?

What's the problem ?

Thanks,
Lorenzo
