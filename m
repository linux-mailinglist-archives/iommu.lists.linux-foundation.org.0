Well, IOMMU does care if its a native mm_struct or something that belongs
to guest. Because you need ability to forward page-requests and pickup
page-responses from guest. Since there is just one PRQ on the IOMMU and
responses can't be sent directly. You have to depend on vIOMMU type
interface in guest to make all of this magic work right?

Not sure what you mean by "match guest memory layout"? 
Probably, meaning first level is gVA or gIOVA? 

Cheers,
