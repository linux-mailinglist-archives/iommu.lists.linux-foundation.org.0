If the patch was adding a "brcm,insecure-dma-pool" compatible and 
hooking it up, I'd be less bothered. As it is, I remain unconvinced that 
describing two things that are not interchangeable with each other as 
interchangeable with each other is in any way "better".

Would you be happy to give me blanket permission to point a gun at your 
foot and pull the trigger at any point in the future, if right now I 
show you an unloaded gun?

Security and lazy shortcuts do not mix well. You are literally arguing 
that mainline Linux should support a back-door ABI for illegal DT 
properties which at worst has the potential to defeat a generic security 
feature. The "restricted-dma-pool" binding explicitly says "When using 
this, the no-map and reusable properties must not be set" (I should spin 
up a patch enforcing that in the schema...). No matter how convinced you 
are that no OS past present or future could possibly ever behave 
differently from the particular downstream software stack you care 
about, NAK to subverting the "restricted-dma-pool" compatible in any 
way, sorry. I for one wish to have no part in the next 
trendy-name-compromise down the line where a protected VM can be tricked 
into exposing its page cache to a "DMA attack" by an untrusted 
hypervisor because fixing Florian's bootloader is hard.

Cheers,
Robin.
