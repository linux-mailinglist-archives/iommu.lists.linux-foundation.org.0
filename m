Note that the "linux,dma-default" stuff is really only for NOMMU (with 
caches), so hardly relevant to arm64.

Didn't some ARMv7 implementations permit unexpected cache hits for the 
non-cacheable address if the same PA has been speculatively fetched via 
the cacheable alias?

I don't think "shared-dma-pool" carries any particular expectation 
itself of how things are mapped, especially since "reusable" effectively 
implies a cacheable mapping for 'normal' kernel usage.

Absent "reusable" to take things down the CMA path instead, "no-map" 
would currently be needed for coherent devices, since even when the CPU 
is guaranteed to bypass the cacheable alias the device can still 
inadvertently snoop it and see stale data. However if the device *is* 
coherent then it would seem more sensible to skip the remap entirely and 
just use the linear map address of the pool, unless of course it needs 
to be shared by multiple devices some of which are non-coherent... :/

Agreed.
