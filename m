Oops, the ping did register, I just didn't react outwardly ;)

I have been working on v2, and plan to have something ready next week - 
the holdup was that I started refactoring all the argument passing since 
the number of things we have to carry through from one end of map/unmap 
to the other is getting a bit silly, but I think I can still finish the 
TTBR1 quirk without that, so if I don't get it cracked imminently then 
I'll put it aside to revisit later.

Robin.
