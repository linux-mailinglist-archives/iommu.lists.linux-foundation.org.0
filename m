Good point, I'll keep that in mind and give option 2 a try.

The iommu binding documentation [1] mentions that

    The device tree node of the IOMMU device's parent bus must contain a valid
    "dma-ranges" property that describes how the physical address space of the
    IOMMU maps to memory. An empty "dma-ranges" property means that there is a 
    1:1 mapping from IOMMU to memory.

which, if I understand this correctly, means that the 'dma-ranges' for the
parent bus of the iommu should be empty since the DART hardware can see the
full physical address space with a 1:1 mapping.


The documentation also mentions that

     When an "iommus" property is specified in a device tree node, the IOMMU
     will be used for address translation. If a "dma-ranges" property exists
     in the device's parent node it will be ignored.

which means that specifying a 'dma-ranges' in the parent bus of any devices
that use the iommu will just be ignored.

As a concrete example, the PCIe DART IOMMU only allows translations from iovas
within 0x00100000...0x3ff00000 to the entire physical address space (though
realistically it will only map to 16GB RAM starting at 0x800000000 on the M1).

I'm probably just confused or maybe the documentation is outdated but I don't
see how I could specify "this device can only use DMA addresses from
0x00100000...0x3ff00000 but can map these via the iommu to any physical
address" using 'dma-ranges'.

Could you maybe point me to the right direction or give me a small example?
That would help a lot!



Thanks,

Sven
