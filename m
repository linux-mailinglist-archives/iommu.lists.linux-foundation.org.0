The current SVA APIs are all device-based, so implicitly reflect 
whichever SMMU instance serves the given device. Once domains come into 
the picture, callers are going to have to be more aware that a domain 
may be specific to a particular IOMMU instance, and potentially allocate 
separate domains for separate devices to represent the same address 
space, much like vfio_iommu_type1_attach_group() does.

It's not really worth IOMMU drivers trying to support a domain spanning 
potentially-heterogeneous instances internally, since they can't 
reasonably know what matters in any particular situation. That's 
primarily why we've never tried to do it in the SMMU drivers. It's a lot 
easier for relevant callers to look at what they get and figure out 
whether any mismatch in capabilities is tolerable or not.
