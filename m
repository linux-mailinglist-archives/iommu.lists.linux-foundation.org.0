Maybe I am looking at the wrong code, I thought
mmu_notifier_ops.free_notifier() is called outside spinlock with
call_srcu(), which will be invoked in the thread context.
in mmu_notifier.c mmu_notifier_put()
	spin_unlock(&mm->notifier_subscriptions->lock);

	call_srcu(&srcu, &subscription->rcu, mmu_notifier_free_rcu);

Anyway, if we have to use atomic. I tried atomic notifier first, there
are two subscribers to the free event on x86.
1. IOMMU
2. KVM

For #1, the problem is that in the free operation, VT-d driver
needs to do a lot of clean up in thread context.
- hold a mutex to traverse a list of devices
- clear PASID entry and flush cache

For #2, KVM might be able to deal with spinlocks for updating VMCS
PASID translation table. +Hao

Perhaps two solutions I can think of:
1. Use a cyclic IOASID allocator. The main reason of clean up at free
is to prevent race with IOASID alloc. Similar to PID, 2M IOASID
will take long time overflow. Then we can use atomic notifier and a
deferred workqueue to do IOMMU cleanup. The downside is a large and
growing PASID table, may not be a performance issue since it has TLB.

2. Let VFIO ensure free always happen after unbind. Then there is no
need to do cleanup. But that requires VFIO to keep track of all the
PASIDs within each VM. When the VM terminates, VFIO is responsible for
the clean up. That was Yi's original proposal. I also tried to provide
an IOASID set iterator for VFIO to free the IOASIDs within each VM/set,
but the private data belongs to IOMMU driver.

Thanks,

Jacob
