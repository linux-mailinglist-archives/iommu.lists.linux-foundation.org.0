The perf call-graph before and after is below. Interesting to see how 
long the mapping takes. So changing the io-pgtable depth may help here.

The unmapping speed improves - I don't know why it doesn't help the 8x 
disk scenario throughput, which these profiles are based on.

JFYI, our HW guys are quite concerned with the SMMU programming 
interface, specifically having a single submission queue which requires 
locking or some sort of synchronization. Obviously it's not a single 
culprit for consuming time.

I tried to capture a record for direct DMA, but dma_direct_map_sg et al 
wasn't even showing in graph. That's the target...
