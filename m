Actually, the plan (and part of the reason for this patch) is to
transition the display driver over to using the DMA API rather than
creating IOMMU domains explicitly.

Explicit IOMMU usage currently works around this prior to Tegra186
because IOMMU translations are not enabled until after the device has
been attached to the IOMMU, at which point a mapping will already have
been created. It's also part of the reason why we don't support DMA-
type domains yet on Tegra SMMU, because as soon as we do, this would
cause a fault storm during boot.

On Tegra186 this same problem exists because the driver does support DMA
type domains and hence the kernel will try to set those up for display
during early boot and before the driver has had a chance to set up
mappings (or quiesce the display hardware).

I do understand those issues, but there's really not a lot we can do
about it. It's wrong for CMA to overlap with the framebuffer from which
the display hardware just keeps scanning out, so all that these reserved
memory nodes do is actually fix a long-standing bug (depending on how
paranoid you are, you might even consider it a security hole).

For older devices that don't have a bootloader that properly defines
this memory as reserved, they should be able to continue to use a CMA
that overlaps with the framebuffer and work just like before.

I'm not trying to ignore all those people, but at the same time I don't
think legacy devices about which we can't do much should prevent new
devices from doing the right thing and properly reserving memory that
the kernel isn't supposed to use.

You already suggested that we could choose an identity domain by default
for VDE and display for this. That sounds like a good compromise to me,
but I think we should do that only on platforms where we can't implement
this properly.

I'd still like to do this properly at least on Tegra210 as well. It
should be possible to come up with a set of criteria where the dummy
identity domain should be used and where it shouldn't. I think that's
the easiest part of this and can easily be implemented as a couple-of-
lines quirk in some kernel driver.
