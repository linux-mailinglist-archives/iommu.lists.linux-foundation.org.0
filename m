Yes, I realise that, but what I'm saying is that a big part of your
justification for this change is:

  | The problem is that memory barrier is very expensive and dma_[un]map_sg()
  | and dma_sync_sg_for_{device|cpu}() involves the memory barrier per every
  | single cache sg entry. In some CPU micro-architecture, a single memory
  | barrier consumes more time than cache clean on 4KiB.

and my point is that the DSB is likely completing the cache maintenance,
so as cache maintenance instructions retire faster in the micro-architecture,
the DSB becomes absolutely slower. In other words, it doesn't make much
sense to me to compare the cost of the DSB with the cost of the cache
maintenance; what matters more is the code of the high-level unmap()
operation for the sglist.

Latency is fine too, but phrasing the numbers (and we really need those)
in terms of things like "The interrupt response time for this in-tree
driver is improved by xxx ns (yy %) after this change" or "Throughput
for this in-tree driver goes from xxx mb/s to yyy mb/s" would be really
helpful.

Non-coherent DMA sucks for software. For the most part, Linux does a nice
job of hiding this from device drivers, and I think _that_ is the primary
concern, rather than performance. If performance is a problem, then the
solution is cache coherence or a shared non-cacheable buffer (rather than
the streaming API).

It's death by a thousand cuts; this patch further fragments the architecture
backends and leads to arm64-specific behaviour which consequently won't get
well tested by anybody else. Now, it might be worth it, but there's not
enough information here to make that call.
