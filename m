Thanks for looping me in Saravana.

In the Qualcomm case we have a number of stream mappings installed when
the bootloader jumps to the OS, each one with SMR/S2CR referring to a CB
with SMMU_CBn_SCTLR.M not set.

As such the relevant hardware is able to access (without translation)
DDR even with SMMU_CR0.USFCFG being set.

The one case where this causes issues is that upon attaching a device to
a context we'll set SMMU_CBn_SCTLR.M, so until we actually have a
translation installed we do get faults - the difference is that these
are not picked up as fatal faults by the secure firmware, so they are
simply reported in Linux.

It might be possible that we can install page tables and setup 1:1
mappings for the necessary resources, but it's not all devices with a
memory-region and a iommu context defined that should have this.

I will have to discuss this in more detail with the Qualcomm engineers.

PS. One detail that I did notice while distilling the downstream patches
is that unused mappings must have SMMU_S2CRx.CBNDX = 255 or I get odd
crashes when the display (CBNDX = 0) is active. I've yet to conclude
why this is.

Bjorn
