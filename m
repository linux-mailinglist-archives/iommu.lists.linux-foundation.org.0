Realistically, if you're building an IOMMU driver as a module then it needs
to be part of the initrd and fw_devlink needs to be enabled. Relying on
timeouts and the phase of the moon is not going to be reliable.

But back to the original issue, I think we should revert the Kconfig patch
from Linus' tree. Please can you send a revert for that?
