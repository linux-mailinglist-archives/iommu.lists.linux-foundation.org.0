Hi Jason,

Thanks for the quick review.

Exactly, will incorporate in the next version.

This works. I had ioasid_t *pasid in my previous version but thinking we
can simplify the interface since we can have the reserved INVALID_IOASID
for return status.
But it seems to me _get_ does not convey the message that this API
actually enables/attaches the kernel DMA PASID. Perhaps call it
iommu_attach_dma_api_pasid() as you suggested in the ops function?

I was thinking RID is per device, this PASID == RID. We could put in pci_dev
but there are non-PCI devices use SSID/PASID.

This also makes sense, default domain is stored per group. To support
multiple devices per group, we still need a per device flag for devTLB
flush. Right?

i.e. while doing iova unmap, IOTLBs are flush for all devices, but we
only need to flush the device TLBs for devices that has kernel DMA PASID.

Good to know, thanks.

Exactly! will incorporate.
