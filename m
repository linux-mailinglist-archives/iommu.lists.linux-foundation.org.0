Got your point. I am not familiar with VDPA but for VFIO UAPI, it is
very thin, mostly passthrough IOMMU UAPI struct as opaque data.

Are we talking about bare metal SVA? If so, I don't see the need for
userspace to know there is a PASID. All user space need is that my
current mm is bound to a device by the driver. So it can be a one-step
process for user instead of two.

Why separate? Drivers need to be involved in PASID life cycle
management. For example, when tearing down a PASID, the driver needs to
stop DMA, IOMMU driver needs to unbind, etc. If driver is the control
point, then things are just in order. I am referring to bare metal SVA.

For guest SVA, I agree that binding is separate from PASID allocation.
Could you review this doc. in terms of life cycle?
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/8/22/13

My point is that /dev/sda has no value for bare metal SVA, we are just
talking about if guest SVA UAPIs can be consolidated. Or am I missing
something?
