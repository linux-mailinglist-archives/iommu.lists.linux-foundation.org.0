Nit: strictly, drivers don't call add_dma_entry(). Drivers only call the 
DMA API functions, and it is the DMA API internals which take a detour 
through dma-debug when desired.

Is that true? It doesn't look like anything in dma-debug itself can 
obviously lead to that; I was assuming that in Jeremy's case it's the 
driver which has managed to do something such that every new mapping 
call it makes ends up hitting the warning. A busy network interface is 
probably more than capable of saturating the kernel log with a print for 
every packet (particularly a great big 100GBE-capable multi-queue thing 
like that one).

Unless there's some subtlety I'm missing, it would be better to use 
err_printk() here - not only for consistency of output, but also to tie 
in with dma-debug's existing output-limiting controls.
