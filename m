Good question, AFAIK the device names are based on the DT node address 
and
the node name, for ex:  etr@6048000 and device name - "6048000.etr", now 
I
believe these are pretty stable for a particular SoC or board since 
there
is no reason to change the device node name or the address unless 
something
has gone terribly wrong. I don't know about ACPI systems, but however 
they
are described can be specified in this command line parameter. This is 
an
advantage over the DT property where ACPI systems get left out unless 
someone
goes and adds the same/similar property over there.

Agreed that command line parameters are not supposed to be some primary
way of setting things but an optional way to override settings, in this
case to override the strict mode already set by the driver. Then we can
probably agree that this command line is just an optional way provided
to the end user for his convenience? We would still need to find a 
primary
way to set this non-strict mode in drivers via DT passing the 
information
or some other way.

If you choose to pass the information via DT which seems like the most 
ideal
way, then you would still have to update them per-board for every board 
you
maintain which is the same thing.

Same as above where we need to modify DT to mark certain devices as 
strict
in case something goes wrong.

Hmm, so then we'd have tens of Kconfigs for each device being non strict
by default?  Then I guess we'd need a menuconfig for this and where 
should
this go into, IOMMU layer or under respective drivers? Let's say we do 
this,
but how would the IOMMU know about such classes of devices, the only way 
I
can think of is adding such a field in "struct device" which can be 
tried
but may not be well received.

Also default should be strict in my opinion as it is today similar to 
bypassing
SMMU and then non strict option to override it.

If tagging is based on the DT property then we have ACPI to think about 
and it
poses the same problems which you listed for command line parameter 
where you
would have to go and update all the DT entries.

Yes this is true but then we can keep this cmdline parameter as only 
optional
and find a different way to enforce the non-strict mode setting.

Agreed, so we can treat non-strict command line parameter as just 
optional
and we find a different way to set this mode in drivers via whatever 
method
everyone finds suitable.
