Those two things are totally separate things when it comes to a device.

One (external) describes the location of the device in the system.

The other (untrusted) describes what you want the kernel to do with this
device (trust or not trust it).

One you can change (from trust to untrusted or back), the other you can
not, it is a fixed read-only property that describes the hardware device
as defined by the firmware.

Depending on the policy you wish to define, you can use the location of
the device to determine if you want to trust the device or not.

Again, this is what USB does, but I'm getting really tired of saying
this, so I'm going to stop now...
