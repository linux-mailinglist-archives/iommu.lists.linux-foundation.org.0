Sigh, you're quite right, and now I have a vague feeling that you called 
that out in the previous discussion too, so apologies for forgetting.

Agreed, trying to figure out which are the VFIO devices from within the 
iommu_group iterator seems beyond the threshold of practicality.

Quick consensus then: does anyone have a particular preference between 
changing the .attach_group signature vs. adding a helper based on 
vfio_group_get_from_iommu() for type1 to call from within its callback? 
They seem about equal (but opposite) in terms of the simplicity vs. 
impact tradeoff to me, so I can't quite decide conclusively...

Thanks,
Robin.
