Does this mean #ifdef CONFIG_PPC in vfio core to retain infrastructure
for POWER support?

I guess I was assuming that enabling v2 migration in QEMU was dependent
on the existing type1 dirty tracking because it's the only means we
have to tell QEMU that all memory is perpetually dirty when we have a
DMA device.  Is that not correct?  If we don't intend to carry type1
dirty tracking into iommufd compatibility and we need it for this
purpose, then our window for being able to rip it out entirely closes
when QEMU gains v2 migration support.

Ok, that's a more promising outlook than I was inferring from the long

Which is kind of the basis for my question, QEMU is racing for native
support, Eric and Yi are already working on this, so some of these
compatibility interfaces might only have short term usefulness.

Agreed.

That's essentially what I'm trying to reconcile, we're racing both
to round out the compatibility interface to fully support QEMU, while
also updating QEMU to use iommufd directly so it won't need that full
support.  It's a confusing message.  Thanks,

Alex
