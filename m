Yea. I can see why in that case, as we're checking
!IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_MODULES) directly in
driver_deferred_probe_check_state.

I guess we could switch that to checking
(driver_deferred_probe_timeout == -1) which would have the same logic
and at least make it consistent if someone specifies -1 on the command
line (since now it will effectively have it EPROBE_DEFER forever in
that case). But also having a timeout=infinity could be useful if
folks don't want the deferring to time out.  Maybe in the !modules
case setting it to =0 would be the most clear.

But that's sort of a further cleanup. I'm still more worried about the
NFS failure below.

Thanks so much for helping clarify this!

So it's at least good to hear that booting with
deferred_probe_timeout=0 is working!  But I'm bummed the NFS (or as
you pointed out in your later mail,  ip_auto_config) falls over
because the network isn't immediately there.

Looking a little closer at the ip_auto_config() code, I think the
issue may be that wait_for_device_probe() is effectively returning too
early, since the probe_defer_timeout is still active? I need to dig a
bit more on that code, on Monday, as I don't fully understand it yet.

If I can't find a way to address that, I think the best course will be
to set the driver_deferred_probe_timeout value to default to 0
regardless of the value of CONFIG_MODULES, so we don't cause any
apparent regression from previous behavior. That will also sort out
the less intuitive = -1 initialization in the non-modules case.

In any case, I'll try to have a patch to send out on Monday.

thanks
-john
