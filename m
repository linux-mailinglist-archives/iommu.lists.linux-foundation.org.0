It can be, we have been using this for USB devices for many many years
now, quite successfully.  The key is not to trust that the platform
firmware got it right :)

Again, we have been doing this for USB devices for a very long time, PCI
shouldn't be any different.  Why people keep ignoring working solutions
is beyond me, there's nothing "special" about PCI devices here for this
type of "worry" or reasoning to try to create new solutions.

So, again, I ask, go do what USB does, and to do that, take the logic
out of the USB core, make it bus-agnositic, and _THEN_ add it to the PCI
code.  Why the original submitter keeps ignoring my request to do this
is beyond me, I guess they like making patches that will get rejected :(

thanks,
