FWIW, if efficiency *is* a practical concern, even under the current 
allocation scheme it looks like there are only 4 actual DMA allocations 
to search through. From a quick scan (since it's too hot here not to get 
distracted...), if I wanted to optimise this in future I'd probably 
remove the semi-redundant allocgrp_* fields from struct blogic_ccb and 
hang a dedicated list of the block allocations off the adapter - at that 
point the lookup could likely already be more efficient than a 
theoretical dma_to_virt() interface would be if it had to go off and 
walk an IOMMU pagetable. Then the next question would be whether it's 
viable to make a single 32KB allocation rather 4*8KB, so it's no longer 
even a list.

For now, though, I agree with the simple change that's clear and easy to 
reason about:
