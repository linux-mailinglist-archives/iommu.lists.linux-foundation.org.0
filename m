I'm not sure why you're trying to treat these cases differently. It's also
not "just because of SMMU", is it? Like I said, kexec() would be broken
regardless.

The bottom line is that after running ->shutdown() (or skipping it if it's
not implemented) for a driver, then the device must no longer perform DMA.

Given that the SMMU mediates DMA transactions for all upstream masters
based on in-memory data (e.g. page tables), then I think it's a /very/
good idea to tear that down as part of the shutdown callback before
the memory is effectively free()d.

One thing I would be in favour of is changing the ->shutdown() code to
honour disable_bypass=1 so that we put the SMMU in an aborting state
instead of passthrough. Would that help at all? It would at least
avoid the memory corruption on missing shutdown callback.

I don't see the problem with that. Why is it a problem?
