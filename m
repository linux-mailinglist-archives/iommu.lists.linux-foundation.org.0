You're calling this an admin knob, which to me suggests a global module
option, so are you trying to implement both an administrator and a user
policy?  ie. the user can create scenarios where access to wbinvd might
be justified by hardware/IOMMU configuration, but can be limited by the
admin?

For example I proposed that the ioasidfd would bear the responsibility
of a wbinvd ioctl and therefore validate the user's access to enable
wbinvd emulation w/ KVM, so I'm assuming this module option lives
there.  I essentially described the "enable" behavior in my previous
reply, user has access to wbinvd if owning a non-coherent capable
device managed in a non-coherent IOASID.  Yes, the user IOASID
configuration controls the latter half of this.

What then is "automatic" mode?  The user cannot create a non-coherent
IOASID with a non-coherent device if the IOMMU supports no-snoop
blocking?  Do they get a failure?  Does it get silently promoted to
coherent?

In "disable" mode, I think we're just narrowing the restriction
further, a non-coherent capable device cannot be used except in a
forced coherent IOASID.

Yes, at this point the user has the ability to create a configuration
where they could have access to wbinvd, but if they haven't created
such a configuration, is the wbinvd a no-op?

Of course.

QEMU is responsible for making sure the VM is consistent; if
non-coherent DMA can occur, wbinvd is emulated.  But it's still the
KVM/IOASID connection that validates that access.

I think my previous reply was working towards those guidelines.  I feel
like we're mostly in agreement, but perhaps reading past each other.
Nothing here convinced me against my previous proposal that the
ioasidfd bears responsibility for managing access to a wbinvd ioctl,
and therefore the equivalent KVM access.  Whether wbinvd is allowed or
no-op'd when the use has access to a non-coherent device in a
configuration where the IOMMU prevents non-coherent DMA is maybe still
a matter of personal preference.

Ok, I'm not opposed to something like a module option that restricts to
only coherent DMA, but we need to work through how that's exposed and
the userspace behavior.  The most obvious would be that a GET_INFO
ioctl on the ioasidfd indicates the restrictions, a flag on the IOASID
alloc indicates the coherency of the IOASID, and we fail any cases
where the admin policy or hardware support doesn't match (ie. alloc if
it's incompatible with policy, attach if the device/IOMMU backing
violates policy).  This is all a compatible layer with what I described
previously.  Thanks,

Alex
