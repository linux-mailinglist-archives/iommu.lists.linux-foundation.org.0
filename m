yes, ioasid is the page table. But if want to let the 4 mdevs share the
same page table, it would be natural to let them share a domain. Since
mdev_device is not hw device, we should not let it participate in the
IOMMU. Therefore we got the aux-domain concept. mdev(RID#+PASID) is
attached to aux-domain. Such solution also fits the hybrid cases. e.g.
When there are both PF(RID#1) and mdev(RID#2+PASID) assigned to an ioasid,
they should share a page table as well. right? Surely we cannot attach the
PF(RID#1) to the domain of mdev's parent device(RID#2). Good way is PF(RID#1)
and the mdev (RID#2+PASID) attached to a single domain. This domain is
the primary domain for the PF(RID#1) but an aux-domain mdev's paretn(RID#2).
