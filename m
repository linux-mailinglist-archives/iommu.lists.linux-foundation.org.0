Er, the point of the block layer case is that whole area *is* zeroed to 
begin with, and a latent memory corruption problem in SWIOTLB itself 
replaces those zeros with random other kernel data unexpectedly. Let me 
try illustrating some sequences for clarity...

Expected behaviour/without SWIOTLB:
                              Memory
---------------------------------------------------
start                        12345678
dma_map(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)      no-op
device writes partial data   12ABC678 <- ABC
dma_unmap(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)   12ABC678


SWIOTLB previously:
                              Memory      Bounce buffer
---------------------------------------------------
start                        12345678    xxxxxxxx
dma_map(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)             no-op
device writes partial data   12345678    xxABCxxx <- ABC
dma_unmap(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)   xxABCxxx <- xxABCxxx


SWIOTLB Now:
                              Memory      Bounce buffer
---------------------------------------------------
start                        12345678    xxxxxxxx
dma_map(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)     12345678 -> 12345678
device writes partial data   12345678    12ABC678 <- ABC
dma_unmap(DMA_FROM_DEVICE)   12ABC678 <- 12ABC678


Now, sure we can prevent any actual information leakage by initialising 
the bounce buffer slot with zeros, but then we're just corrupting the 
not-written-to parts of the mapping with zeros instead of anyone else's 
old data. That's still fundamentally not OK. The only thing SWIOTLB can 
do to be correct is treat DMA_FROM_DEVICE as a read-modify-write of the 
entire mapping, because it has no way to know how much of it is actually 
going to be modified.

I'll admit I still never quite grasped the reason for also adding the 
override to swiotlb_sync_single_for_device() in aa6f8dcbab47, but I 
think by that point we were increasingly tired and confused and starting 
to second-guess ourselves (well, I was, at least). I don't think it's 
wrong per se, but as I said I do think it can bite anyone who's been 
doing dma_sync_*() wrong but getting away with it until now. If 
ddbd89deb7d3 alone turns out to work OK then I'd be inclined to try a 
partial revert of just that one hunk.

Thanks,
Robin.
