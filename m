Right, but we really need two here. One for DMA request w/o PASID (PASID 0)
and a kernel PASID for DMA request tagged w/ PASID.
Since DMA API is not per process, there is no need for more right now.

Not that I know.

Right, DMA API default to PASID 0. But IDXD device cannot use PASID 0 for
enqcmds.

IDXD can do DMA w/ RID, the PASID requirement is only for shared WQ where
ENQCMDS is used. ENQCMDS has the benefit of avoiding locking where work
submission is done from multiple CPUs.
Tony, Dave?

What would you recommend in the interim?

Shall we let VT-d driver set up a special global PASID for DMA API? Then
IDXD driver can retrieve it somehow? But that still needs an API similar to
what I did in the previous version where PASID #1 was used.

Thanks,

Jacob
