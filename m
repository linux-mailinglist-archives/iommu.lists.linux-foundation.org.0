We have already got the domain id from the device's dma-ranges of DT. In
this case, we don't need rebuild the kernel, right? they only need
update the dma-ranges in DT.

Assume we have already adjusted the iova of engine A to 4G~8G with the
below array, if it don't use dma-ranges in DT, It will abort at [1]
since we have already updated the domain->geometer.aperture_start/end to
4G~8G and the default base/size in this function always are 0/4G.

If this simple array work, I won't add dom_id in DT at the begginning.

As you may already know, we determine the domain by port number within
the larb rather that the larb number. If using the array, It should be
something like:

static u8 mt8192_domain_map[NUM_DOMAINS][NUM_LARBS_MAX] = {  
    /* Each a bit represent a port. ~0 means all ports in domain 0. */
    [0] = {~0, ~0, },   /* larb0/1 in domain 0 */
    [1] = { 0, 0, 0, 0, ~0, ~0, 0, ~0, }, /* larb4/5/7 in domain1 */
    [2] = { 0, 0, ~0 ....}, 
    /* CCU0: larb13 bit9/10  */
    [3] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, BIT(9) | BIT(10)}
    /* CCU1: larb14 port4/5*/
    [4] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, BIT(4) | BIT(5)},
};

This array looks a bit complex. I didn't like it before.

I may not following you here. What's the benefit for this? The problem
is that larb13-port-9/10 and larb14-port4/5 should be a separate address
space, the others can not occupy their ranges.


In the end, the dma-range can not be omited in two case:
a) the iova over 4GB.
b) the special engine that can only support a special range.
right?

Actually we support the device adjust their dma-ranges like from 4G~8G
to 8G~12G. but we also have our limitation. How about I reword comment
in the mtxxxx-larb-port.h like:

/*
 * MM IOMMU supports 16GB dma address. We seperate it to four banks:
 * 0 ~ 4G; 4G ~ 8G; 8G ~12G; 12G ~ 16G. we could adjust these master
 * locate any banks. BUT
 * 1) Make sure all the ports in a larb are in one bank.
 * 2) The iova of any master can NOT cross the 4G/8G/12G boundary.
 * 3) If there is some special master require a special iova range,
 *    Make sure the other port in that larb locate in the same bank.
 *
 * This is the suggested mapping in this SoC:
 * 
 * modules      iova-range             larbs-ports
 * display       0 ~ 4G                   larb0/1
 * vcodec        4G ~ 8G                  larb4/5/7
 * cam/mdp       8G ~ 12G             larb2/9/11/13/14/16/17/18/19/20
 * CCU0    0x2_4000_0000 ~ 0x2_43ff_ffff     larb13: port 9/10
 * CCU1    0x2_4400_0000 ~ 0x2_47ff_ffff     larb14: port 4/5
 *
 * In this SoC, CCU have a special iova range requirement, that means
larb13/larb14 always need locate 8G ~ 16G.
 *
 */

We list our limitation and suggesting. If someone would like adjust the
dma-ranges, then he should make sure it follow these rules and guarantee
the drivers works, I means If a iova-A comes from another iommu domain,
the master should map it again in its own domain to make sure the HW
works.

How about this? or still think the array is better?

About the command line, because I have fixed the CCU0/1 in 8G~12G in the
driver code, and this is possible to be adjusted in command-line. This
is only for larb13/14. and could be added when necessary.(currently I
think we no need this).

And in the code I will add 12 ~ 16G support.
