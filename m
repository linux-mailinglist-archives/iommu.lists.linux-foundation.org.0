I think certain POWER models do this, yes, there's *protection*
between DMAs from different devices, but you can't translate the same
address to different places for different devices.  I *think* that's a
firmware/hypervisor convention rather than a hardware limitation, but
I'm not entirely sure.  We don't do things this way when emulating the
POWER vIOMMU in POWER, but PowerVM might and we still have to deal
with that when running as a POWERVM guest.
