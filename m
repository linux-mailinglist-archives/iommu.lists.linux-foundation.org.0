Hi Jean,
Thanks for the feedback, please see replies inline.

In our use case, we need token to ioasid_set lookup. e.g. VFIO creates
an ioasid_set with a token. KVM instance needs to know the
ioasid_set based on its mm. So ioasid_find() does not know the set
until it finds it based on the token and token type.

That would be fine with VT-d. We can use init_mm for host PASID set,
process mm for VM set.

what is the set argument used for? In my view, ioasid_set and mm are
1:1 mapped.

struct ioasid_set *ioasid_alloc_set(void *token, ioasid_t quota)


I was thinking we still have APIs for IOASID set alloc/free since we
want to embed ioasid_set info in driver data structures for ownership
check.

I don't get why we need ioasid to find the set token. If we put
mm_struct* inside ioasid_set, then we can get the token from the set
directly.

I will keep that in mind in my next set. I think it would be much
easier to explain with code.

My takeaway is that we have a high-level agreement to have explicit mm
as token in IOASID APIs. I think we can work out the details with
patches.
