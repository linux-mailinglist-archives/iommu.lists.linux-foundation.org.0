Oh, right... I did say I found this dance hard to follow. Clearly I 
shouldn't have trusted what I thought I remembered from looking at it 
yesterday :)

Also not helped by the fact that it sets iommu_detected which *does* 
disable SWIOTLB, but only on IA-64.

Certainly if there's a precedent for leaving SWIOTLB enabled even if it 
*might* be redundant, that seems like the easiest option (it's what we 
do on arm64 too, but then we have system topologies where some devices 
may not be behind IOMMUs even when others are). More fun would be to try 
to bring it up at the first sign of IOMMU_DOMAIN_IDENTITY if it was 
disabled previously, but I don't have the highest hope of that being 
practical.

Robin.
