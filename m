Thank you, Kevin.

When will you send this series patches? Maybe(Hope) we can also support
hardware-based dirty pages tracking via common APIs based on your patches. :)

Currently HTTU just implement A/D-like mechanism in SMMU page tables. We certainly
expect SMMU can also implement PML-like feature so that we can avoid walking the
whole page table to get the dirty pages.

By the way, I'm not sure whether HTTU or SLAD can help for mediated deivce.
