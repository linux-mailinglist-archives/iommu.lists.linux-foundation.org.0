device_links_check_suppliers() call inside really_probe() would short
circuit and return an -EPROBE_DEFER if the device links are created as
expected.

Hmmm... this is strange (that the device link isn't there), but this
is what I suspected.

Now we need to figure out why it's missing. There are only a few
things that could cause this and I don't see any of those. I already
checked to make sure the power domain in this instance had a proper
driver with a probe() function -- if it didn't, then that's one thing
that'd could have caused the missing device link. The device does seem
to have a proper driver, so looks like I can rule that out.

Can you point me to the dts file that corresponds to the specific
board you are testing this one? I probably won't find anything, but I
want to rule out some of the possibilities.

All the device link creation logic is inside drivers/base/core.c. So
if you can look at the existing messages or add other stuff to figure
out why the device link isn't getting created, that'd be handy. In
either case, I'll continue staring at the DT and code to see what
might be happening here.
