Let's not get too hung up on devicetree - you can go out and buy certain 
ACPI-only platforms today that also fall foul of this, for which AFAIK 
the necessary firmware update is in the SoC vendor's hands.

FWIW the meta here is really "oops, you've just installed a new kernel 
and now your machine is unusable - you need to take it up with whoever 
supports your platform, but in the meantime this is the minimal thing 
you can do to get things back working as before."

Personally I'm less concerned about folks maintaining "hardware 
products", as I'd like to assume they would hit this in QA and have a 
relatively short loop back to kernel people who know what's up (or at 
least know enough to join the dots to punt it to my inbox). My main 
concern is end users of SBSA-ish platforms who are free to pick and 
choose distros - and/or kernel packages within their distro - and thus 
may bugger up their machine inadvertently if the distro package happens 
to have picked this option up from defconfig (from a quick look at least 
my preferred one has).

Sounds good, I'll respin with a slight abbreviation of that (and minus 
the embarrassingly stupid thinko) tomorrow.

Cheers,
Robin.
