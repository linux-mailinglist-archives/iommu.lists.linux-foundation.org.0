Hi Rob,

I've been thinking about this some more and I think I've come up with an
alternative that I think you might like better than what we discussed so
far.

Rather than reusing memory-region-names and guessing from the name what
the intended purpose was, how about we add the concept of memory region
specifiers to describe additional properties of reserved memory regions
uses? This would allow us to address Robin's concerns about describing
what's essentially a device property within the reserved memory region.

The way I imagine that this would work is that the reserved memory
regions would gain a new property, "#memory-region-cells", that defines
the number of cells that make up a reserved memory region specifier,
much like we have #clock-cells, #reset-cells, #pwm-cells, etc. Since
these specifier are defined where the regions are used, they would allow
us to encode information about that specific use, rather than properties
of the regions themselves.

This should also allow for backwards-compatibility where a missing
#memory-region-cells would be interpreted as 0 specifier (i.e. no
additional data).

Here's how this would look for the specific example that I want to
solve:

	#define MEMORY_REGION_ACTIVE 0x1

	/ {
		reserved-memory {
			lut: lookup-table@96060000 {
				reg =3D <0x96060000 0x00010000>;
				#memory-region-cells =3D <1>;
			};

			fbc: framebuffer@96070000 {
				reg =3D <0x96070000 0x800000>;
				#memory-region-cells =3D <1>;
			};
		};

		...

		host1x@50000000 {
			...

			display@54200000 {
				...
				memory-regions =3D <&fbc MEMORY_REGION_ACTIVE>,
						 <&lut MEMORY_REGION_ACTIVE>;
				...
			};

			...
		};
	};

As you can see, the reserved memory region nodes only contain properties
that are immediately related to the regions themselves, whereas the
"active" attribute now applies only for the specific use of the region
within display@54200000.

What do you think?

Thierry
