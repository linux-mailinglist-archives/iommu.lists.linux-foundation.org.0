Yes, IOVA allocation can still be a bottleneck - the percpu caching 
system mostly alleviates it, but certain workloads can still defeat 
that, and if you're spending significant time in alloc_iova() rather 
than alloc_iova_fast() then it sounds like yours is one of them.

If you're using small IOVA sizes which *should* be cached, then you 
might be running into a pathological case of thrashing the global depot. 
I've ranted before about the fixed MAX_GLOBAL_MAGS probably being too 
small for systems with more than 16 CPUs, which on a modern AMD system I 
imagine you may well have.

If on the other hand your workload is making larger mappings above the 
IOVA caching threshold, then please take a look at John's series for 
making that tuneable:
