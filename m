"other modules" should never care if a device has a driver bound to it
because instantly after the check happens, it can change so what ever
logic it wanted to do with that knowledge is gone.

Unless the bus lock is held that the device is on, but that should be
only accessable from within the driver core as it controls that type of
stuff, not any random other part of the kernel.

And in looking at this, ick, there are loads of places in the kernel
that are thinking that this pointer being set to something actually
means something.  Sometimes it does, but lots of places, it doesn't as
it can change.

In a semi-related incident right now, we currently have a syzbot failure
in the usb gadget code where it was manipulating the ->driver pointer
directly and other parts of the kernel are crashing.  See
https://lore.kernel.org/r/PH0PR11MB58805E3C4CF7D4C41D49BFCFDA3C9@PH0PR11MB5880.namprd11.prod.outlook.com
for the thread.

I'll poke at this as a background task to try to clean up over time.

thanks,

greg k-h
