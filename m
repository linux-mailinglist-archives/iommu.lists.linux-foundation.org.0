I wonder if it's time to start trying to be a bit cleverer than just 
allocating the smallest/largest possible queues, and try to scale them 
to some heuristic of the "size" of the system? Certainly a module 
parameter so that users can manually tune for their system/workload 
might be a reasonable compromise.

I'm also tempted by the idea of trying to dynamically reallocate larger 
queues if they fill up, but I guess that depends on whether it's already 
game over if events or PRI requests are lost...

Robin.
