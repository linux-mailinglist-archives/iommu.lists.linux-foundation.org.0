I don't think the language in the spec is anything sufficient to handle
RCiEP uniquely.  We've previously rejected kernel command line opt-outs
for ACS, and the extent to which those patches still float around the
user community and are blindly used to separate IOMMU groups are a
testament to the failure of this approach.  Users do not have a basis
for enabling this sort of opt-out.  The benefit is obvious in the IOMMU
grouping, but the risk is entirely unknown.  A kconfig option is even
worse as that means if you consume a downstream kernel, the downstream
maintainers might have decided universally that isolation is less
important than functionality.

I think the only solution is that the hardware vendors need to step up
to indicate where devices are isolated.  The hardware can do this
itself by implementing ACS, otherwise we need quirks.  I think we've
also generally been reluctant to accept quirks that provide a blanket
opt-out for a vendor because doing so is akin to trying to predict the
future (determining the behavior of all current and previous hardware
is generally a sufficiently impossible task already).  Perhaps if a
vendor has a published internal policy regarding RCiEP isolation and is
willing to stand by a quirk, there might be room to negotiate.  Thanks,

Alex
